# Main.py - The Orchestra Conductor 🎼

## 🎯 What This File Does

Think of `main.py` like the **orchestra conductor** who coordinates all the musicians to create beautiful music. Instead of musicians, it coordinates all the ETL modules (extract, transform, load) to create a successful data pipeline.

**Simple explanation**: This file is the "boss" that tells each part of the pipeline when to run, in what order, and what to do if something goes wrong.

**Why it's important**: Without orchestration, you'd have to manually run each step, remember the correct order, and handle errors yourself. The main file automates all of this like a smart project manager!

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By studying this file, you'll learn:
- How to coordinate complex multi-step processes
- Why order matters in data pipelines
- How to handle errors gracefully without crashing everything
- How to track progress and performance
- How to create professional logging and monitoring
- What makes a production-ready data pipeline

## 🔍 Main Parts Explained

### The StarSchemaETLPipeline Class
This is like the **project manager** that oversees the entire data warehouse construction project.

```python
class StarSchemaETLPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config: StarSchemaConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.logger = self._setup_logging()
        
        # Initialize pipeline components
        self.extractor = DataExtractor(config)
        self.transformer = StarSchemaTransformer(config)
```

**What this does**: 
- Sets up logging to track everything that happens
- Creates instances of all the workers (extractor, transformer, loaders)
- Prepares to track pipeline performance and results

### Pipeline State Tracking
```python
self.pipeline_results = {
    "success": False,
    "extraction_results": {},
    "transformation_results": {},
    "dimension_loading_results": {},
    "fact_loading_results": {},
    "validation_results": {},
    "total_duration_seconds": 0,
    "errors": []
}
```

**Think of this like**: A project status board that tracks every phase and whether it succeeded or failed.

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. Phase-Based Execution (The Assembly Line)
```python
def run_full_pipeline(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Phase 1: Data Extraction
    extraction_results = self._run_extraction_phase()
    
    # Phase 2: Data Transformation  
    transformation_results = self._run_transformation_phase(extraction_results)
    
    # Phase 3: Dimension Loading
    dimension_results = self._run_dimension_loading_phase(transformation_results)
    
    # Phase 4: Fact Loading
    fact_results = self._run_fact_loading_phase(transformation_results, dimension_results)
    
    # Phase 5: Validation
    validation_results = self._run_validation_phase()
```

**Think of this like**: A factory assembly line where each station must complete its work before the next station can start.

**Why order matters**:
- **Extract first**: Can't transform data you don't have
- **Transform second**: Can't load messy data into a clean warehouse  
- **Dimensions third**: Facts need dimension keys to work
- **Facts fourth**: Can't validate what isn't loaded yet
- **Validate last**: Check that everything worked correctly

### 2. Error Handling (The Safety Net)
```python
try:
    # Try to run extraction
    extraction_results = self._run_extraction_phase()
    self.pipeline_results["extraction_results"] = extraction_results
except Exception as e:
    error_msg = f"ETL Pipeline failed: {str(e)}"
    self.logger.error(error_msg, exc_info=True)
    self.pipeline_results["errors"].append(error_msg)
finally:
    # Always calculate duration and log summary
    self.pipeline_results["total_duration_seconds"] = time.time() - self.start_time
    self._log_pipeline_summary()
```

**What this does**: If any phase fails, log the error but still provide a complete report of what happened.

**Think of this like**: A safety coordinator who documents incidents but makes sure the project status is always clear.

### 3. Professional Logging (The Project Journal)
```python
def _setup_logging(self) -> logging.Logger:
    # Create log directory if it doesn't exist
    log_dir = Path(self.config.log_file).parent
    log_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Configure both file and console logging
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(self.config.log_file, mode="w")
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)
```

**What this creates**:
- **File logs**: Detailed records saved to disk for later analysis
- **Console logs**: Real-time updates you can see while pipeline runs
- **Different levels**: INFO for normal updates, WARNING for issues, ERROR for failures

**Think of this like**: A project manager who keeps detailed written records AND gives verbal updates to the team.

## 🔍 Phase Methods Breakdown

### 1. Extraction Phase
```python
def _run_extraction_phase(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    self.logger.info("Starting data extraction from all sources...")
    
    extraction_results = self.extractor.extract_all_sources()
    
    # Log summary
    metadata = extraction_results.get("_metadata", {})
    total_records = metadata.get("total_records", 0)
    self.logger.info(f"Extraction completed: {total_records} total records")
    
    return extraction_results
```

**Think of this like**: A foreman who supervises loading all the raw materials and reports how much was collected.

### 2. Transformation Phase
```python
def _run_transformation_phase(self, extraction_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    self.logger.info("Starting data transformation for star schema...")
    
    # Transform each dimension type
    customers = extraction_results.get("customers", [])
    dim_customer = self.transformer.prepare_customer_dimension(customers)
    
    # Log progress
    self.logger.info(f"Customer dimension: {len(dim_customer)} records")
```

**Think of this like**: A quality control supervisor who oversees cleaning and preparing all materials before construction.

### 3. Dimension Loading Phase
```python
def _run_dimension_loading_phase(self, transformation_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    self.logger.info("Starting dimension loading with SCD Type 1...")
    
    with DimensionLoader(self.config) as dimension_loader:
        dimension_results = dimension_loader.load_all_dimensions(transformation_results)
    
    return dimension_results
```

**Think of this like**: A foundation contractor who builds the structural framework that everything else depends on.

### 4. Fact Loading Phase
```python
def _run_fact_loading_phase(self, transformation_results: Dict[str, Any], dimension_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    fact_sales = transformation_results.get("fact_sales", [])
    
    with FactLoader(self.config) as fact_loader:
        fact_results = fact_loader.load_sales_facts(fact_sales, dimension_results)
    
    return fact_results
```

**Think of this like**: The main construction crew who builds on the foundation, creating the actual business structure.

### 5. Validation Phase
```python
def _run_validation_phase(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Check row counts in all tables
    # Verify referential integrity
    # Calculate data quality score
    # Return comprehensive validation report
```

**Think of this like**: A building inspector who checks that everything was built correctly and meets quality standards.

## 🛠️ How to Use This

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Make sure you have all your data files and database ready
# Set up your .env file with database credentials
```

### Step 2: Run the Complete Pipeline
```python
# Simple execution
python main.py

# Or programmatically
from main import StarSchemaETLPipeline
from config import load_config

config = load_config()
pipeline = StarSchemaETLPipeline(config)
results = pipeline.run_full_pipeline()
```

### Step 3: Check the Results
```python
if results["success"]:
    print("✅ Pipeline completed successfully!")
    print(f"⏱️ Duration: {results['total_duration_seconds']:.2f} seconds")
else:
    print("❌ Pipeline failed")
    for error in results["errors"]:
        print(f"   Error: {error}")
```

## 🎓 Study Tips

### 🤔 Think About This:
- Why does the order of phases matter so much?
- What would happen if we tried to load facts before dimensions?
- How does comprehensive logging help when things go wrong?

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:
1. **Wrong phase order**: Always extract → transform → load dimensions → load facts
2. **Poor error handling**: Don't let one failure crash the entire pipeline
3. **Inadequate logging**: Log everything - you'll need it when debugging
4. **No progress tracking**: Users need to know what's happening and how long it takes

### 🏆 Job Interview Ready:
Be able to explain:
- "How do you orchestrate a multi-step data pipeline?"
- "What's your approach to error handling in ETL processes?"
- "How do you monitor and track pipeline performance?"
- "Why is logging important in production data pipelines?"

### 🔗 How This Connects:
- **config.py** provides the settings for all pipeline components
- **extract.py, transform.py, load_dimensions.py, load_facts.py** are the workers
- **main.py** is the boss that coordinates all the workers

## 🧪 Testing Your Understanding

Try these exercises:
1. Trace what happens if the extraction phase fails
2. Explain why we pass results from one phase to the next
3. Design how you'd add a new phase (like data quality reporting)

## 📊 Real-World Applications

Pipeline orchestration patterns like this are used in:
- **Apache Airflow**: Professional workflow orchestration
- **AWS Glue**: Cloud ETL orchestration

## 🔥 Advanced Features in This Code

### Comprehensive Error Recovery
```python
try:
    # Try each phase
    extraction_results = self._run_extraction_phase()
    self.pipeline_results["extraction_results"] = extraction_results
except Exception as e:
    # Log error but continue with pipeline reporting
    error_msg = f"Extraction phase failed: {str(e)}"
    self.logger.error(error_msg)
    self.pipeline_results["errors"].append(error_msg)
    # Pipeline doesn't crash - still produces final report
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
self.start_time = time.time()
# ... run pipeline phases ...
self.pipeline_results["total_duration_seconds"] = time.time() - self.start_time
```

### Detailed Pipeline Reporting
```python
def _log_pipeline_summary(self):
    self.logger.info("=" * 60)
    self.logger.info("ETL Pipeline Execution Summary")
    self.logger.info("=" * 60)
    
    success = self.pipeline_results.get("success", False)
    self.logger.info(f"Pipeline Status: {'SUCCESS' if success else 'FAILED'}")
    
    duration = self.pipeline_results.get("total_duration_seconds", 0)
    self.logger.info(f"Total Duration: {duration:.2f} seconds")
```

### Multi-Level Logging
```python
# Different log levels for different audiences
self.logger.info("Normal pipeline progress")      # For operators
self.logger.warning("Data quality issues found")  # For data teams  
self.logger.error("Pipeline component failed")    # For engineers
```

## 🌟 Why This Matters
