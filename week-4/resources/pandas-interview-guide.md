# Pandas for Data Engineering Interviews

## Introduction

This guide helps you confidently discuss Pandas in data engineering interviews. As a Java bootcamp graduate with SQL experience, you have a unique perspective that interviewers value. This resource focuses on the most commonly asked Pandas questions and how to frame your answers professionally.

## Common Interview Questions and How to Answer Them

### 1. "How do you handle large datasets that don't fit in memory?"

**What they're really asking:** Can you work with production-scale data?

**Your answer approach:**
- Start with chunking (`pd.read_csv(chunksize=n)`)
- Mention data type optimization
- Connect to your SQL experience with pagination

**Sample answer:**
> "When working with large datasets, I use pandas chunking to process data in manageable pieces, similar to how I'd use OFFSET/LIMIT in SQL for pagination. I'd read the file in chunks of 50,000-100,000 rows using `pd.read_csv(chunksize=50000)`, process each chunk, and aggregate results. I also optimize data types upfront - using `int32` instead of `int64` when possible, and `category` for repetitive strings, which can reduce memory usage by 50% or more."

### 2. "What's the difference between `apply()` and vectorized operations?"

**What they're really asking:** Do you understand performance optimization?

**Your answer approach:**
- Explain vectorized operations work on entire columns at once
- Mention that `apply()` is essentially a loop in disguise
- Give a concrete example

**Sample answer:**
> "Vectorized operations work on entire pandas Series at once using optimized NumPy operations underneath, while `apply()` processes data row by row or element by element. For example, calculating `df['total'] = df['price'] * df['quantity']` is vectorized and much faster than `df['total'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['price'] * row['quantity'], axis=1)`. Coming from Java development, I think of vectorization like using Stream operations efficiently versus traditional for-loops."

### 3. "How do you merge data in pandas versus SQL?"

**What they're really asking:** Can you translate your SQL knowledge to pandas?

**Your answer approach:**
- Draw clear parallels to SQL JOINs
- Mention the different join types
- Show you understand the syntax

**Sample answer:**
> "Pandas merge is very similar to SQL JOINs. I use `df1.merge(df2, on='key_column', how='left')` which is equivalent to SQL's `LEFT JOIN`. The `how` parameter supports 'left', 'right', 'inner', and 'outer' - just like SQL. I can also merge on multiple columns using `on=['col1', 'col2']` or handle cases where column names differ using `left_on` and `right_on` parameters."

### 4. "How do you handle missing data in pandas?"

**What they're really asking:** Do you make thoughtful decisions about data quality?

**Your answer approach:**
- Show you understand different strategies for different scenarios
- Mention business context matters
- Connect to data validation concepts

**Sample answer:**
> "I handle missing data based on business context. For numerical data, I might use `fillna()` with mean or median values. For categorical data, I might fill with 'Unknown' or the mode. Sometimes `dropna()` is appropriate if missing data indicates invalid records. I always validate my approach - for instance, if 'age' has null values, filling with median makes sense, but if 'customer_id' is null, that's probably a data quality issue that needs investigation."

### 5. "Explain pandas groupby operations"

**What they're really asking:** Can you translate SQL GROUP BY concepts?

**Your answer approach:**
- Draw direct parallels to SQL GROUP BY
- Show you understand split-apply-combine
- Mention aggregation functions

**Sample answer:**
> "Pandas groupby works just like SQL's GROUP BY. For example, `df.groupby('category').agg({'sales': 'sum', 'quantity': 'mean'})` is equivalent to `SELECT category, SUM(sales), AVG(quantity) FROM table GROUP BY category` in SQL. The groupby operation splits the data, applies functions, and combines results. I can use multiple aggregation functions and even custom functions with `apply()`."

### 6. "How do you optimize pandas performance?"

**What they're really asking:** Do you think about production considerations?

**Your answer approach:**
- Mention data type optimization
- Talk about vectorization
- Show awareness of memory management

**Sample answer:**
> "I optimize pandas performance in several ways: First, I optimize data types during loading - using `category` for strings with few unique values, `int32` instead of `int64` when values allow, and specifying dtypes in `read_csv()`. Second, I use vectorized operations instead of `apply()` when possible. Third, I use method chaining to create efficient transformation pipelines. For large datasets, I implement chunking to manage memory usage."

## Technical Concepts to Master

### Data Types and Memory Management

```python
# Demonstrate your understanding
def optimize_dataframe_types(df):
    """Show how you'd optimize a DataFrame"""
    memory_before = df.memory_usage().sum()
    
    # Optimize integer columns
    for col in df.select_dtypes(include=['int64']):
        max_val = df[col].max()
        if max_val < 32767:
            df[col] = df[col].astype('int16')
    
    # Optimize categorical columns  
    for col in df.select_dtypes(include=['object']):
        if df[col].nunique() / len(df) < 0.5:
            df[col] = df[col].astype('category')
    
    memory_after = df.memory_usage().sum()
    print(f"Memory reduced by {(1-memory_after/memory_before)*100:.1f}%")
    
    return df
```

### Method Chaining vs. Step-by-Step

```python
# Show you understand both approaches
# Method chaining (preferred for readability)
result = (df
          .query('amount > 0')
          .groupby('category')
          .agg({'amount': 'sum'})
          .sort_values('amount', ascending=False)
          .head(10))

# Step-by-step (good for debugging)
step1 = df.query('amount > 0')
step2 = step1.groupby('category').agg({'amount': 'sum'})
step3 = step2.sort_values('amount', ascending=False)
result = step3.head(10)
```

### Window Functions (Advanced)

```python
# Show SQL OVER clause equivalents
df['running_total'] = df.groupby('customer_id')['amount'].cumsum()
df['rank_by_amount'] = df.groupby('category')['amount'].rank(ascending=False)
df['pct_of_category_total'] = df['amount'] / df.groupby('category')['amount'].transform('sum')
```

## Questions You Should Ask the Interviewer

### About the Data Stack
- "What's your current data architecture? Do you use both SQL and NoSQL databases?"
- "How do you handle data quality and validation in your ETL pipelines?"
- "What's the typical size of datasets I'd be working with?"

### About the Role
- "What does a typical data engineering project look like here?"
- "How do you balance speed of delivery with code quality in data projects?"
- "What opportunities are there to grow into more advanced data engineering topics?"

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Say These Things
- "I only know basic pandas" (even if true - focus on what you DO know)
- "I've never worked with production data" (instead: "I'm excited to apply my skills to larger datasets")
- "Pandas is just like Excel" (it's not, and this shows misunderstanding)

### Instead, Show Growth Mindset
- "I've focused on mastering the fundamentals and I'm excited to tackle larger challenges"
- "I understand the concepts and I'm ready to apply them at scale"
- "I've built solid foundations and I learn quickly"

## Sample Coding Questions and Solutions

### Question 1: Data Cleaning
"Given a DataFrame with missing values, how would you clean it for analysis?"

```python
def clean_sales_data(df):
    # Check data quality first
    print(f"Missing values per column:\n{df.isnull().sum()}")
    
    # Clean based on business rules
    cleaned = (df
               .dropna(subset=['customer_id'])  # Essential field
               .assign(
                   amount=lambda x: x['amount'].fillna(x['amount'].median()),
                   category=lambda x: x['category'].fillna('Unknown')
               )
               .query('amount > 0'))  # Business rule
               
    print(f"Cleaned: {len(df)} -> {len(cleaned)} records")
    return cleaned
```

### Question 2: Business Analysis
"Calculate monthly sales trends by product category."

```python
def monthly_sales_analysis(df):
    return (df
            .assign(month=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x['date']).dt.to_period('M'))
            .groupby(['month', 'category'])
            .agg({
                'amount': 'sum',
                'order_id': 'count',
                'customer_id': 'nunique'
            })
            .rename(columns={'order_id': 'total_orders', 'customer_id': 'unique_customers'})
            .round(2))
```

### Question 3: Performance Optimization
"How would you optimize this slow operation?"

```python
# Slow version (don't do this)
def slow_calculation(df):
    df['category_total'] = df.apply(
        lambda row: df[df['category'] == row['category']]['amount'].sum(), 
        axis=1
    )
    return df

# Fast version (do this)
def fast_calculation(df):
    df['category_total'] = df.groupby('category')['amount'].transform('sum')
    return df
```
