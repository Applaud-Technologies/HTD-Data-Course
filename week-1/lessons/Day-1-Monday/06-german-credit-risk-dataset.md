# Dataset 1: German Credit Risk

## Introduction

Breaking through data silos remains one of the most persistent challenges for software developers. Modern applications rarely interact with just one data source—they must seamlessly pull from flat files, analytical databases, enterprise systems, and cloud services. 

This lesson tackles this challenge by exploring multiple connection methods using the German Credit Risk dataset as our testing ground. You'll implement practical strategies ranging from straightforward CSV imports to more sophisticated database connections, each with distinct trade-offs that parallel common software architecture decisions. By mastering these connection patterns, you'll develop the flexibility to integrate data from virtually any source into your applications—a critical skill that distinguishes adaptable developers from those constrained by rigid tooling limitations. Let's examine how these methods work across different scenarios and the software design principles they reflect.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should be familiar with:
- Basic DuckDB installation and setup (covered in the previous lesson)
- Fundamental SQL concepts
- Python basics for data manipulation

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Implement multiple connection methods including CSV imports, DuckDB connections, SQL Server connections, and connection strings to access the German Credit Risk dataset.

## Implement Multiple Connection Methods to Access the German Credit Risk Dataset

Data access patterns mirror software architecture principles—both require thoughtful consideration of interfaces, efficiency, and resilience. Let's explore how to connect to the German Credit Risk dataset through various methods, each offering different trade-offs similar to how API designs balance functionality with performance.

### CSV File Imports

CSV files represent one of the most fundamental data exchange formats in analytics—simple, portable, and universally supported. The German Credit Risk dataset is commonly distributed as a CSV file with approximately 1,000 rows and 20 columns covering attributes like loan amount, credit history, and employment status.

When importing CSV data, you're essentially implementing a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, similar to how frontend applications fetch and transform API data. The primary advantage lies in simplicity and portability.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import urllib.request
import os

# Download the German Credit Risk dataset from a public repository
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data"
local_filename = "german_credit.csv"

if not os.path.exists(local_filename):
    print(f"Downloading dataset to {local_filename}...")
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, local_filename)
    print("Download complete!")
else:
    print(f"Using existing file: {local_filename}")

# Define column names (as they're not included in the original file)
column_names = [
    'account_status', 'duration', 'credit_history', 'purpose', 'credit_amount',
    'savings', 'employment_duration', 'installment_rate', 'personal_status_sex',
    'other_debtors', 'present_residence', 'property', 'age', 'other_installment_plans',
    'housing', 'existing_credits', 'job', 'num_dependents', 'telephone', 'foreign_worker',
    'credit_risk'
]

# Read the CSV file using pandas
df = pd.read_csv(local_filename, sep=' ', header=None, names=column_names)

# Basic verification of the data structure
print("First 5 rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())

# Display basic information about the dataset
print("\nDataset information:")
print(df.info())

# Convert categorical variables to appropriate data types
categorical_columns = ['account_status', 'credit_history', 'purpose', 'savings', 
                       'personal_status_sex', 'other_debtors', 'property', 
                       'other_installment_plans', 'housing', 'job', 'telephone', 
                       'foreign_worker', 'credit_risk']

df[categorical_columns] = df[categorical_columns].astype('category')

# Verify the conversion
print("\nData types after conversion:")
print(df.dtypes)
```

```

The above approach mirrors how microservices might consume external data feeds—direct import with minimal intermediary processing. However, just as service boundaries create data duplication challenges in distributed systems, this method creates isolated data copies that can drift from the source over time.

### DuckDB Connections

DuckDB, as covered in our previous lesson, excels at analytical workloads while maintaining a lightweight footprint. Connecting DuckDB to the German Credit Risk dataset combines the performance benefits of a database engine with the simplicity of file-based operations.

This approach parallels how backend services might implement a caching layer—data remains close to computation for efficiency while maintaining a structured query interface.

```python
import duckdb
import pandas as pd
import os

# Create a new DuckDB connection
# The database will be persisted to disk as 'german_credit.duckdb'
conn = duckdb.connect('german_credit.duckdb')

# Check if we already have the CSV file from previous example
csv_file = 'german_credit.csv'
if not os.path.exists(csv_file):
    # If not, download it (simplified version of previous code)
    import urllib.request
    url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data"
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, csv_file)
    print(f"Downloaded dataset to {csv_file}")

# Define column names
column_names = [
    'account_status', 'duration', 'credit_history', 'purpose', 'credit_amount',
    'savings', 'employment_duration', 'installment_rate', 'personal_status_sex',
    'other_debtors', 'present_residence', 'property', 'age', 'other_installment_plans',
    'housing', 'existing_credits', 'job', 'num_dependents', 'telephone', 'foreign_worker',
    'credit_risk'
]

# Create a table in DuckDB and import the CSV directly
# First, check if the table already exists
table_exists = conn.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='german_credit'").fetchone()

if not table_exists:
    # Create a SQL statement with column definitions
    create_table_sql = f"""
    CREATE TABLE german_credit (
        {', '.join([f'{col} {"INTEGER" if col in ["duration", "credit_amount", "age", "existing_credits"] else "VARCHAR"}' for col in column_names])}
    )
    """
    conn.execute(create_table_sql)
    
    # Import the CSV data into the table
    conn.execute(f"""
    COPY german_credit FROM '{csv_file}' 
    (DELIMITER ' ', HEADER FALSE)
    """)
    print("Created table and imported data")
else:
    print("Table already exists")

# Verify the import with a simple SQL query
result = conn.execute("""
SELECT 
    credit_risk, 
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(credit_amount) as avg_credit_amount,
    AVG(age) as avg_age

ORDER BY credit_risk
""").fetchall()

print("\nSummary statistics by credit risk:")
for row in result:
    risk_label = "Good Risk" if row[0] == '1' else "Bad Risk"
    print(f"{risk_label}: {row[1]} customers, Avg Credit: {row[2]:.2f}, Avg Age: {row[3]:.2f}")

# Query to show distribution of credit purposes
purpose_dist = conn.execute("""
SELECT purpose, COUNT(*) as count
FROM german_credit
GROUP BY purpose
ORDER BY count DESC
""").fetchall()

print("\nCredit purpose distribution:")
for purpose, count in purpose_dist:
    print(f"Purpose {purpose}: {count} applications")

# Demonstrate how to retrieve data as a pandas DataFrame
df = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM german_credit LIMIT 5").df()
print("\nFirst 5 rows as pandas DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Close the connection to ensure data is persisted
conn.close()
print("\nDatabase connection closed and data persisted to disk")
```

```console

Database connection closed and data persisted to disk
```

The DuckDB connection method provides a SQL interface to your data without the overhead of a client-server database. This mirrors how modern applications often embed lightweight databases (like SQLite or LevelDB) for local data persistence while maintaining query capabilities.

> **Note:** DuckDB's direct CSV import capabilities bypass the need for intermediate tools like pandas, reducing memory overhead for large datasets—similar to how edge computing pushes processing closer to data sources to reduce network traffic.

### SQL Server Connections

Enterprise environments often store valuable datasets in client-server database systems like SQL Server. Connecting to such systems requires understanding network protocols, authentication mechanisms, and query optimization—skills that parallel connecting to backend services in distributed applications.
```python
import pandas as pd
import pyodbc
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file (if available)
load_dotenv()

def connect_to_sql_server():
    """Establish a connection to SQL Server with error handling"""
    try:
        # Get connection details from environment variables or use defaults
        server = os.getenv('SQL_SERVER', 'localhost')
        database = os.getenv('SQL_DATABASE', 'CreditRiskDB')
        username = os.getenv('SQL_USERNAME', 'sa')
        password = os.getenv('SQL_PASSWORD', 'YourStrongPassword')
        
        # Create the connection string
        conn_str = f'DRIVER={{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}};SERVER={server};DATABASE={database};UID={username};PWD={password}'
        
        # Establish the connection
        conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)
        print(f"Successfully connected to {database} on {server}")
        return conn
    
    except pyodbc.Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to SQL Server: {e}")
        # Provide a helpful message for common connection issues
        if 'Login failed' in str(e):
            print("Check your username and password")
        elif 'Cannot open database' in str(e):
            print("Database may not exist - check database name")
        elif 'SQL Server Network Interfaces' in str(e):
            print("Server may be unreachable - check server name and network")
        return None

    if not conn:
        print("No active connection")

        return df

This method mirrors how enterprise applications implement data access layers—through standardized drivers, connection pools, and query interfaces. Just as microservice architectures must handle service discovery and resilient connections, database clients must handle connection management and retries.

### Connection Strings

Connection strings serve as configuration interfaces to data sources—conceptually similar to how API keys and endpoints configure service integrations. They encapsulate authentication details, network locations, and performance parameters in a standardized format.

Connection string best practices:
1. Never hardcode credentials in your scripts
2. Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive information
3. Consider connection pooling for production applications
4. Include timeout and retry logic for network connections
```

Connection strings parallel configuration management in software development—both solve the problem of environment-specific settings that shouldn't be hardcoded. Just as DevOps practices separate code from configuration, data professionals separate queries from connection details.

> **Note:** Throughout this lesson, relevant software development concepts such as external API integrations, database drivers, and connection pooling will be discussed in context rather than as separate topics.

## Coming Up

In the next lesson, "Entity-Relationship Diagram Basics," you will learn about fundamental database design concepts including entities (e.g., customers), attributes (e.g., customer_id), relationships (e.g., one-to-many), and primary/foreign keys. These concepts will help you better understand the structure of databases like the German Credit Risk dataset.

## Key Takeaways

- CSV imports provide maximum portability but minimal query capabilities, making them ideal for initial exploration and small datasets.
- DuckDB connections combine SQL query power with file-based simplicity, enabling analytical capabilities without infrastructure overhead.
- SQL Server connections offer enterprise-grade features like transactions and security but require more complex setup and maintenance.
- Connection strings abstract access details, enhancing security and flexibility while following the software principle of configuration separation.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we explored multiple approaches to accessing the German Credit Risk dataset, each offering different trade-offs that mirror architectural decisions in software development. CSV imports provide maximum portability for initial exploration, DuckDB connections offer analytical power without infrastructure overhead, SQL Server connections deliver enterprise-grade features when needed, and connection strings abstract away access details for enhanced security and configuration management. 

These patterns form the foundation of data integration regardless of specific technologies, giving you the flexibility to work with data in its native environment rather than forcing everything into a single paradigm. As data environments grow increasingly heterogeneous, this adaptability becomes crucial for effective engineering. In our next lesson on Entity-Relationship Diagrams, you'll build on these connection skills by learning how to model data relationships through entities, attributes, and keys—essential concepts for understanding the structural foundations that underpin any well-designed database.

## Glossary

- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: A plain-text file format that uses commas to separate values, commonly used for tabular data exchange.
- **Connection String**: A formatted string containing connection information such as server addresses, credentials, and database names.
- **DuckDB**: An in-process analytical database designed for OLAP workloads, combining the simplicity of SQLite with analytical capabilities.
- **SQL Server**: Microsoft's enterprise database platform offering advanced features like stored procedures, triggers, and comprehensive security.
- **Database Driver**: Software that enables applications to interact with specific database systems by translating generic commands to database-specific protocols.
- **Connection Pooling**: A technique that maintains a cache of database connections for reuse, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.
