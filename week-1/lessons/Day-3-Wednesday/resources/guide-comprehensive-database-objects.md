## 1 ¬∑ Views üîç

### 1.1 What Are Views? üîë

A *view* is a stored SELECT statement that behaves like a table. Think of it as a reusable *lens* on your data, providing a logical abstraction over your physical tables.

**Benefits of Views:**
- Simplifies complex joins and aggregations
- Provides a stable interface for applications even when underlying schema changes
- Enforces security through column and row-level access control
- Improves code reuse and standardization

### 1.2 Creating and Managing Views

| Task | Syntax | Explanation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Create read-only view üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_SalesSummary AS SELECT CustomerID, SUM(LineTotal) AS Revenue FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail GROUP BY CustomerID; ``` | Stores the query text in `sys.sql_modules`. Each time you run `SELECT * FROM dbo.vw_SalesSummary`, SQL Server rewrites it as the underlying SELECT. |
| Alter view | ```sql ALTER VIEW dbo.vw_SalesSummary WITH SCHEMABINDING AS SELECT CustomerID, SUM(LineTotal) AS Revenue FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail GROUP BY CustomerID; ``` | Updates an existing view definition. `WITH SCHEMABINDING` prevents changes to underlying tables without first altering the view. |
| Drop view | ```sql DROP VIEW dbo.vw_SalesSummary; ``` | Removes the view definition from the database. |
| Refresh view metadata | ```sql EXEC sp_refreshview 'dbo.vw_SalesSummary'; ``` | Updates view metadata after structural changes to underlying tables. |
| Grant access üîí | ```sql GRANT SELECT ON dbo.vw_SalesSummary TO role_reporting; ``` | Gives read-only access to specific users or roles without exposing underlying tables. |

### 1.3 View Types and Advanced Options

#### Standard Views

Basic views with no special properties. They query underlying tables each time they're called.

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_ActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName, ContactName
FROM Sales.Customers
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

#### Schema-Bound Views

These views have a dependency lock on underlying tables, preventing schema changes that would break the view.

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_OrderSummary
WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT 
    o.OrderID,
    c.CustomerName,
    SUM(d.Quantity * d.UnitPrice) AS OrderTotal,
    COUNT_BIG(*) AS LineItemCount
FROM dbo.Orders o
JOIN dbo.Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN dbo.OrderDetails d ON o.OrderID = d.OrderID
GROUP BY o.OrderID, c.CustomerName;
```

#### Indexed Views (Materialized Views) ‚ö°

Indexed views physically store the result set, significantly improving query performance for complex aggregations.

```sql
-- Step 1: Create schema-bound view
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_ProductSales
WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT 
    p.ProductID,
    p.ProductName,
    SUM(d.Quantity) AS TotalSold,
    SUM(d.Quantity * d.UnitPrice) AS Revenue,
    COUNT_BIG(*) AS OrderCount
FROM dbo.Products p
JOIN dbo.OrderDetails d ON p.ProductID = d.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName;

-- Step 2: Create unique clustered index to materialize the view
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_vw_ProductSales
ON dbo.vw_ProductSales(ProductID);
```

üí° **Pro tip:** Indexed views are most beneficial for:
- Expensive aggregations that are queried frequently
- Data that changes relatively infrequently
- Queries with high I/O costs

‚ö° **Performance note:** In SQL Server, indexed views are automatically leveraged in Enterprise Edition. In Standard Edition (2016+), you need to use the `NOEXPAND` hint.

### 1.4 Cross-Database View Syntax

| Database | Basic View Syntax | Materialized View Approach |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| SQL Server | `CREATE VIEW name AS SELECT...` | Clustered index on schema-bound view |
| PostgreSQL | `CREATE VIEW name AS SELECT...` | `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW name AS SELECT...` |
| MySQL | `CREATE VIEW name AS SELECT...` | No native support (use tables instead) |
| Oracle | `CREATE VIEW name AS SELECT...` | `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW name AS SELECT...` |

#### PostgreSQL Materialized View Example

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;

-- Manual refresh (no incremental updates)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales_summary;
```

### 1.5 View Limitations and Considerations

- Views generally cannot accept parameters (use functions or procedures instead)
- Complex views with multiple joins can perform poorly if not indexed
- ORDER BY in views is ignored unless combined with TOP/OFFSET-FETCH
- Updateable views have many restrictions (avoid when possible)

---

## 2 ¬∑ Stored Procedures ‚öôÔ∏è

### 2.1 What Are Stored Procedures? üîë

Stored procedures are precompiled collections of SQL statements and optional control flow that are stored in the database. They function as database-side applications, encapsulating business logic.

**Benefits of Stored Procedures:**
- Reduced network traffic (send procedure name + parameters instead of entire query)
- Enhanced security through granular permissions
- Code reusability across applications
- Potential for cached execution plans
- Batching multiple operations into atomic transactions

### 2.2 Creating and Managing Procedures

| Task | Syntax | Explanation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Create basic procedure üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql CREATE OR ALTER PROC dbo.usp_GetCustomerOrders @CustomerID INT AS BEGIN SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, od.LineTotal FROM Sales.Orders o JOIN Sales.OrderDetail od ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID WHERE o.CustomerID = @CustomerID; END; ``` | Creates a procedure that accepts a parameter and returns a result set. |
| Add error handling üîí | ```sql CREATE PROC dbo.usp_UpdateInventory @ProductID INT, @Quantity INT AS BEGIN BEGIN TRY BEGIN TRANSACTION; UPDATE Inventory SET QuantityOnHand = QuantityOnHand - @Quantity WHERE ProductID = @ProductID; COMMIT; END TRY BEGIN CATCH ROLLBACK; SELECT ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber, ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage; END CATCH; END; ``` | Implements transaction control and error handling. |
| Add output parameters üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql CREATE PROC dbo.usp_CreateOrder @CustomerID INT, @OrderID INT OUTPUT AS BEGIN INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerID, OrderDate) VALUES (@CustomerID, GETDATE()); SET @OrderID = SCOPE_IDENTITY(); END; ``` | Returns values through output parameters. |
| Execute procedure | ```sql DECLARE @NewOrderID INT; EXEC dbo.usp_CreateOrder @CustomerID = 123, @OrderID = @NewOrderID OUTPUT; SELECT @NewOrderID AS 'New Order ID'; ``` | Shows how to call a procedure with output parameters. |
| Grant execution rights üîí | ```sql GRANT EXECUTE ON dbo.usp_GetCustomerOrders TO role_app; ``` | Gives execute permission without granting table access. |

### 2.3 Advanced Procedure Techniques

#### Dynamic SQL in Procedures

For flexible queries where the criteria or columns vary:

```sql
CREATE PROC dbo.usp_DynamicSearch
    @TableName NVARCHAR(128),
    @SearchColumn NVARCHAR(128),
    @SearchValue NVARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);
    
    SET @SQL = N'SELECT * FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@TableName) + 
               N' WHERE ' + QUOTENAME(@SearchColumn) + 
               N' LIKE @SearchParam';
    
    EXEC sp_executesql @SQL, 
         N'@SearchParam NVARCHAR(100)', 
         @SearchParam = '%' + @SearchValue + '%';
END;
```

üîí **Security tip:** Always use parameterized dynamic SQL with `sp_executesql` to prevent SQL injection.

#### Table-Valued Parameters

For passing multiple rows as a parameter:

```sql
-- First create a table type
CREATE TYPE OrderDetailsType AS TABLE
(
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    UnitPrice MONEY
);
GO

-- Use the table type as a parameter
CREATE PROC dbo.usp_CreateOrderWithDetails
    @CustomerID INT,
    @OrderDetails OrderDetailsType READONLY
AS
BEGIN
    -- Create order header
    DECLARE @OrderID INT;
    INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerID, OrderDate)
    VALUES (@CustomerID, GETDATE());
    
    SET @OrderID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
    
    -- Add order details from table parameter
    INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice)
    SELECT @OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice
    FROM @OrderDetails;
    
    RETURN @OrderID;
END;
```

#### Parameter Sniffing Issues ‚ö°

Parameter sniffing occurs when SQL Server reuses an execution plan optimized for a specific parameter value, which might be suboptimal for different parameter values.

**Common solutions:**

1. Use `OPTION (RECOMPILE)` for queries with highly variable data distributions:

```sql
CREATE PROC dbo.usp_GetCustomerOrders @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, od.LineTotal
    FROM Sales.Orders o
    JOIN Sales.OrderDetail od ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = @CustomerID
    OPTION (RECOMPILE);
END;
```

2. Use local variables to break parameter sniffing:

```sql
CREATE PROC dbo.usp_GetCustomerOrders @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @LocalCustomerID INT = @CustomerID;
    
    SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, od.LineTotal
    FROM Sales.Orders o
    JOIN Sales.OrderDetail od ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = @LocalCustomerID;
END;
```

3. Use `OPTIMIZE FOR` hints for known typical values:

```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, od.LineTotal
FROM Sales.Orders o
JOIN Sales.OrderDetail od ON od.OrderID = o.OrderID
WHERE o.CustomerID = @CustomerID
OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR (@CustomerID = 1000));
```

### 2.4 Cross-Database Procedure Syntax

| Database | Basic Procedure Syntax | Error Handling Approach |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| SQL Server | `CREATE PROC name AS BEGIN ... END;` | `BEGIN TRY ... BEGIN CATCH ... END CATCH` |
| PostgreSQL | `CREATE FUNCTION name() RETURNS void AS $$ BEGIN ... END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;` | `BEGIN ... EXCEPTION WHEN ... END;` |
| MySQL | `CREATE PROCEDURE name() BEGIN ... END;` | `DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION ...` |
| Oracle | `CREATE PROCEDURE name AS BEGIN ... END;` | `BEGIN ... EXCEPTION WHEN ... END;` |

## 3 ¬∑ Temporary Structures üì¶

### 3.1 Temp Tables

Temporary tables exist in the `tempdb` database and are automatically dropped when they go out of scope.

#### Types of Temp Tables

| Type | Syntax | Scope | Visibility |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| Local temp table | `#TableName` | Session | Creating session only |
| Global temp table | `##TableName` | Server | All sessions until last connection closes |

#### Working with Temp Tables

| Task | Syntax | Explanation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Create with SELECT INTO üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount INTO #RecentOrders FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE()); ``` | Fast way to create and populate a temp table. |
| Create with explicit schema üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql CREATE TABLE #CustomerAnalysis ( CustomerID INT, OrderCount INT, TotalSpend MONEY, AvgOrderValue AS (TotalSpend / OrderCount) ); INSERT INTO #CustomerAnalysis (CustomerID, OrderCount, TotalSpend) SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*), SUM(TotalAmount) FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID; ``` | More control over schema, including computed columns. |
| Add indexes for performance ‚ö° | ```sql CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customer ON #RecentOrders(CustomerID); CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_OrderDate ON #RecentOrders(OrderDate); ``` | Critical for performance when joining or filtering on large temp tables. |
| Check temp table info | ```sql EXEC sp_help '#RecentOrders'; SELECT @@ROWCOUNT AS RowCount; ``` | Displays schema information and row count. |
| Clean up | ```sql DROP TABLE #RecentOrders; ``` | Explicitly drops temp table (good practice in scripts). |

üí° **Pro tip:** Use a naming convention for temp tables to make scripts more readable, e.g., `#stg_` for staging data, `#dim_` for dimension work.

### 3.2 Table Variables

Table variables are memory-optimized alternatives for smaller datasets, with some important differences from temp tables.

```sql
DECLARE @Orders TABLE (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    TotalAmount MONEY
);

INSERT @Orders
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 1234;
```

#### Temp Tables vs. Table Variables

| Characteristic | Temp Tables | Table Variables |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Storage location | tempdb | Memory with potential tempdb spillover |
| Statistics | Yes (updated) | No (assumes 1 row) |
| Transaction logging | Full | Minimal |
| Indexing | All types | Only PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE constraints |
| Scope | Session or global | Batch/procedure only |
| Best for | Larger datasets, complex operations | Small datasets, few rows (<100) |

‚ö° **Performance note:** For larger datasets, temp tables almost always outperform table variables due to statistics and indexing.

### 3.3 Memory-Optimized Table Variables (SQL Server 2014+)

For high-concurrency OLTP workloads, memory-optimized table variables provide significant performance benefits:

```sql
DECLARE @Orders TABLE (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    TotalAmount MONEY
) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON);
```

## 4 ¬∑ Common Table Expressions (CTEs) üìã

### 4.1 What Are CTEs? üîë

Common Table Expressions provide a way to define a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement. They exist only for the duration of the query.

**Benefits of CTEs:**
- Self-contained, improve readability
- Can be referenced multiple times in a query
- Support recursive operations
- Simplify complex queries with logical steps

### 4.2 Basic CTE Syntax

```sql
WITH CTE_Name [(column_list)] AS (
    -- CTE query definition
)
-- Main query that references the CTE
```

| Task | Syntax | Explanation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Simple CTE for readability üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql WITH CustomerSales AS ( SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpend FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID ) SELECT c.CustomerName, cs.TotalSpend FROM Customers c JOIN CustomerSales cs ON c.CustomerID = cs.CustomerID WHERE cs.TotalSpend > 10000 ORDER BY cs.TotalSpend DESC; ``` | Makes complex queries more readable by breaking them into logical chunks. |
| Multiple CTEs | ```sql WITH OrderCounts AS ( SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID ), HighValueCustomers AS ( SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE TotalAmount > 1000 GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 ) SELECT c.CustomerName, oc.OrderCount FROM Customers c JOIN OrderCounts oc ON c.CustomerID = oc.CustomerID WHERE c.CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM HighValueCustomers); ``` | Chain multiple CTEs for step-by-step query logic. |

### 4.3 Recursive CTEs

Recursive CTEs are perfect for hierarchical or graph data, replacing cursors for many use cases.

| Task | Syntax | Explanation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Employee org chart üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql WITH OrgChart AS ( -- Anchor member (starting point) SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, ManagerID, 0 AS Level FROM Employees WHERE ManagerID IS NULL UNION ALL -- Recursive member SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, e.ManagerID, o.Level + 1 FROM Employees e INNER JOIN OrgChart o ON e.ManagerID = o.EmployeeID ) SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Level, REPLICATE('  ', Level) + EmployeeName AS HierarchyDisplay FROM OrgChart OPTION (MAXRECURSION 100); ``` | Traverses employee hierarchy to any depth. |
| Bill of materials üõ†Ô∏è | ```sql WITH PartExplosion AS ( -- Base case: top-level assembly SELECT ProductID, ComponentID, Quantity, 1 AS Level FROM ProductComponents WHERE ProductID = 1000 UNION ALL -- Recursive case: sub-components SELECT pc.ProductID, pc.ComponentID, pc.Quantity * pe.Quantity, pe.Level + 1 FROM ProductComponents pc INNER JOIN PartExplosion pe ON pc.ProductID = pe.ComponentID ) SELECT p.ProductName, pe.Level, pe.Quantity, p.UnitPrice, pe.Quantity * p.UnitPrice AS TotalCost FROM PartExplosion pe JOIN Products p ON pe.ComponentID = p.ProductID ORDER BY pe.Level, p.ProductName; ``` | Explodes a product into all its components and sub-components. |

üí° **Pro tip:** Always include `OPTION (MAXRECURSION n)` in production recursive CTEs to prevent infinite recursion (default limit is 100).

‚ö° **Performance note:** Recursive CTEs can be resource-intensive for deep hierarchies. Consider materializing results in a temp table for complex operations.

### 4.4 Cross-Database CTE Syntax

| Database | Basic CTE Syntax | Recursive CTE Notes |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| SQL Server | `WITH name AS (...)` | Default is breadth-first traversal |
| PostgreSQL | `WITH name AS (...)` | Same as SQL Server |
| MySQL (8.0+) | `WITH name AS (...)` | Must use `WITH RECURSIVE` for recursion |
| Oracle | `WITH name AS (...)` | Default is depth-first traversal |

## 6 ¬∑ Best Practices and Performance Tips

### 6.1 Naming Conventions

| Object Type | Recommended Prefix | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| View | vw_ | vw_CustomerOrders |
| Stored Procedure | usp_ | usp_GenerateInvoice |
| User Function | ufn_ | ufn_CalculateDiscount |
| Local Temp Table | # | #TempCustomers |
| Global Temp Table | ## | ##SharedOrders |
| Table Variable | @ | @OrderItems |
| CTE | CTE_ or purpose | CTE_RankedSales |

### 6.2 Performance Best Practices ‚ö°

**Views:**
- Index materialized views for frequently-run aggregations
- Avoid nested views (views calling views) where possible
- Use SCHEMABINDING to prevent underlying structural changes

**Stored Procedures:**
- Handle parameter sniffing with local variables when needed
- Use SET NOCOUNT ON to reduce network traffic
- Consider OPTION (RECOMPILE) for queries with variable data distributions

**Temp Tables:**
- Always index temp tables that will be joined to other tables
- Drop temp tables explicitly when done
- Beware of statistics becoming stale in long-running processes

**CTEs:**
- Use for readability, but materialize large results to temp tables
- Avoid complex CTEs in UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Set appropriate MAXRECURSION limits on recursive CTEs

### 6.3 Security Considerations üîí

- Use views and stored procedures to implement row-level security
- Grant minimal permissions (SELECT on views, EXECUTE on procedures)
- Avoid dynamic SQL where possible; when used, always parameterize
- Schema-bind objects to prevent structural changes
- Use ENCRYPTION option on sensitive procedures if needed

## 7 ¬∑ Advanced Examples

### 7.1 Partitioned Views for Multi-Tenant Data

```sql
-- Create partition tables for each tenant
CREATE TABLE Sales_Tenant1 (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    TenantID INT CHECK (TenantID = 1),
    OrderDate DATE,
    Amount MONEY
);

CREATE TABLE Sales_Tenant2 (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    TenantID INT CHECK (TenantID = 2),
    OrderDate DATE,
    Amount MONEY
);

-- Create union view
CREATE VIEW vw_Sales WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT OrderID, TenantID, OrderDate, Amount FROM dbo.Sales_Tenant1
UNION ALL
SELECT OrderID, TenantID, OrderDate, Amount FROM dbo.Sales_Tenant2;

-- Create indexed view for all-tenant reporting
CREATE VIEW vw_SalesSummary WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT 
    YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
    MONTH(OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
    COUNT_BIG(*) AS OrderCount,
    SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM dbo.vw_Sales
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate);

CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_SalesSummary 
ON vw_SalesSummary(OrderYear, OrderMonth);
```

### 7.2 Using CTEs for Window Functions

```sql
WITH SalesRanking AS (
    SELECT 
        SalesPersonID,
        YEAR(OrderDate) AS SalesYear,
        MONTH(OrderDate) AS SalesMonth,
        SUM(TotalAmount) AS MonthlySales,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate) 
                   ORDER BY SUM(TotalAmount) DESC) AS SalesRank
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID, YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)
)
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeName,
    sr.SalesYear,
    sr.SalesMonth,
    sr.MonthlySales,
    sr.SalesRank,
    CASE 
        WHEN sr.SalesRank = 1 THEN 'Gold Medal'
        WHEN sr.SalesRank = 2 THEN 'Silver Medal'
        WHEN sr.SalesRank = 3 THEN 'Bronze Medal'
        ELSE '-'
    END AS Achievement
FROM SalesRanking sr
JOIN Employees e ON sr.SalesPersonID = e.EmployeeID
WHERE sr.SalesRank <= 5
ORDER BY sr.SalesYear, sr.SalesMonth, sr.SalesRank;
```

### 7.3 Multi-Step ETL with Stored Procedures and Temp Tables

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_LoadSalesDataWarehouse
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    -- Step 1: Extract raw data to staging
    SELECT * INTO #StagingOrders
    FROM ExternalSource.dbo.Orders
    WHERE LastModified >= DATEADD(DAY, -1, GETDATE());
    
    -- Add indexing for better join performance
    CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Order ON #StagingOrders(OrderID);
    
    -- Step 2: Data cleansing and enrichment
    SELECT 
        s.OrderID,
        s.CustomerID,
        c.CustomerType,
        c.Region,
        s.OrderDate,
        s.TotalAmount,
        p.ProductCategory
    INTO #EnrichedOrders
    FROM #StagingOrders s
    JOIN DimCustomer c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
    JOIN #StagingOrderDetails d ON s.OrderID = d.OrderID
    JOIN DimProduct p ON d.ProductID = p.ProductID;
    
    -- Step 3: Create aggregations
    SELECT 
        CONVERT(DATE, OrderDate) AS OrderDate,
        Region,
        ProductCategory,
        COUNT(DISTINCT OrderID) AS OrderCount,
        SUM(TotalAmount) AS Revenue
    INTO #AggregatedSales
    FROM #EnrichedOrders
    GROUP BY 
        CONVERT(DATE, OrderDate),
        Region,
        ProductCategory;
    
    -- Step 4: Load to target using MERGE
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    MERGE FactDailySales AS target
    USING #AggregatedSales AS source
    ON (target.OrderDate = source.OrderDate 
        AND target.Region = source.Region 
        AND target.ProductCategory = source.ProductCategory)
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET 
            target.OrderCount = source.OrderCount,
            target.Revenue = source.Revenue,
            target.LastUpdated = GETDATE()
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (OrderDate, Region, ProductCategory, OrderCount, Revenue, LastUpdated)
        VALUES (source.OrderDate, source.Region, source.ProductCategory, 
                source.OrderCount, source.Revenue, GETDATE());
    
    COMMIT;
    
    -- Cleanup
    DROP TABLE #StagingOrders, #EnrichedOrders, #AggregatedSales;
END;
