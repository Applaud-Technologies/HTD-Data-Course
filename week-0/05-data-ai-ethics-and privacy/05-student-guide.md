# Student Guide: Data/AI Ethics and Privacy

## Overview

This lesson introduces the ethical frameworks and privacy concerns associated with data and AI. As data-driven systems increasingly impact real-world outcomes in finance, healthcare, hiring, and justice, engineers must be equipped to recognize bias, safeguard privacy, and make responsible decisions throughout the data lifecycle.

## Core Learning Outcomes (Simplified for Reference)

- Differentiate between cognitive and statistical biases in data interpretation.
- Evaluate data sources for credibility, completeness, and potential biases.
- Identify where bias can occur throughout the data lifecycle.
- Apply ethical and legal considerations to data acquisition and interpretation.
- Communicate data responsibly using transparent visualizations and clear limitations.

## Key Vocabulary

| Term                     | Definition                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cognitive Bias**       | Human interpretation errors like confirmation or anchoring bias |
| **Statistical Bias**     | Methodological flaws in data collection or analysis          |
| **Data Provenance**      | Origin and transformation history of a dataset               |
| **Sampling Bias**        | When a dataset doesn't represent the target population       |
| **Survivorship Bias**    | Focus on successful outcomes, ignoring those that failed     |
| **Differential Privacy** | Adds noise to protect individual data in aggregate stats     |
| **Anonymization**        | Removing identifiers to protect individual privacy           |
| **k-anonymity**          | Ensures individuals are indistinct among at least k peers    |
| **P-hacking**            | Manipulating analysis to produce statistically significant results |
| **Selection Bias**       | Systematic exclusion of parts of a population in data collection |
| **Observer Bias**        | When the act of measurement alters responses                 |
| **Privacy Regulation**   | Legal frameworks like GDPR or CCPA that govern data rights   |

## Core Concepts & Takeaways

### Bias Types and Detection

| Bias Type   | Source              | Analogous To                         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Cognitive   | Human judgment      | Assumptions in feature design        |
| Statistical | Sampling or methods | Gaps in test coverage or system logs |

Both types can co-occur—mitigate by using structured thinking and good methodology.

### Data Source Evaluation

Use a framework:

- **Authority**: Who created it?
- **Methodology**: Transparent and replicable?
- **Representation**: Matches target audience?
- **Timeliness**: Is it current?
- **Licensing**: Permitted usage?

Missing or biased data often stems from poor provenance or scraping practices.

### Bias in the Data Lifecycle

Bias can appear at every step:

- **Collection**: Poor sampling, measurement error
- **Processing**: Imputation or transformation artifacts
- **Analysis**: Model overfitting or misinterpretation
- **Reporting**: Visualization tricks or framing bias

Be proactive in each phase to prevent systemic issues.

### Legal & Ethical Boundaries

| Concern             | Approach                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Web Scraping        | Respect robots.txt and TOS                      |
| Licensing           | Comply with open or proprietary data licenses   |
| Personal Data       | Encrypt, anonymize, or use differential privacy |
| Sensitive Use Cases | Prioritize informed consent and transparency    |

Ethics = alignment with social good. Privacy = protection of user identity and data rights.

### Ethical Communication

- Use **zero-baseline** charts unless otherwise justified.
- Avoid truncated axes or deceptive scale changes.
- Always **note confidence intervals** and **sample sizes**.
- Offer **multiple interpretations**, not just one story.
- Label limitations and technical debt in your analysis.

Think like a UI/UX designer building for user trust—not a marketer spinning numbers.

## Tools & Technologies Mentioned

| Tool / Concept                | Usage Context                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Chi-Square / t-Test**       | Comparing group distributions             |
| **Differential Privacy**      | Ensuring anonymized analytics             |
| **k-Anonymity**               | Guaranteeing dataset indistinguishability |
| **Robots.txt**                | Honoring website scrape policies          |
| **Pandas / Python**           | Cleaning and auditing datasets            |
| **Creative Commons Licenses** | Understanding data usage rights           |
