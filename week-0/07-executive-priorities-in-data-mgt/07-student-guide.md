# Student Guide: Executive Priorities in Data Management

## Overview

This lesson bridges the gap between data engineering and executive expectations by aligning technical strategies with business outcomes. It emphasizes how data management practices contribute to revenue, cost control, risk reduction, and strategic advantage—transforming data into a true business asset.

## Core Learning Outcomes (Simplified for Reference)

- Implement data quality strategies focused on business-critical dimensions.
- Reduce data management costs while preserving value and quality.
- Establish governance systems that ensure compliance and operational confidence.
- Translate technical improvements into language and metrics executives value.
- Balance competing executive priorities using structured planning frameworks.

## Core Concepts & Takeaways

### Data Quality Management

| Dimension    | Executive Concern            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Accuracy     | Finance reporting integrity  |
| Completeness | Marketing campaign targeting |
| Consistency  | Operational performance      |
| Timeliness   | Decision-making and alerts   |

Align validation frameworks and stewardship policies with these priorities.

### Cost Optimization

- **Remove redundancy** (e.g., multiple pipelines for same data)
- **Right-size resources** using usage analytics
- **Use tiered storage** and **reserved compute** to reduce spend
- **Balance savings with SLAs** (Service-Level Agreements) for critical workloads

### Governance & Compliance

| Component        | Executive Assurance     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Data catalog     | Business-IT alignment   |
| Access control   | Risk mitigation         |
| Audit trails     | Legal defensibility     |
| Lineage tracking | Regulatory transparency |

Build systems that embed controls rather than layering them on post hoc.

### Demonstrating Business Impact

| Metric          | Executive Value         |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Latency         | Faster decisions        |
| Accuracy        | Revenue integrity       |
| Coverage        | Competitive insight     |
| Pipeline uptime | Operational reliability |

Translate improvements into **risk avoided**, **money saved**, or **growth enabled**.

### Balancing Executive Priorities

Use structured tools:

- **Impact × Feasibility** grid
- **Quarterly roadmap alignment**
- **Modular architecture** to address multiple use cases incrementally

Design initiatives that deliver value across departments—not just IT wins.

## Tools & Technologies Mentioned

| Tool / Concept                                    | Usage Context                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Data Validation**                               | Pipeline quality enforcement          |
| **Materialized Views**                            | Cost-efficient reporting              |
| **Access Control Systems (e.g., RBAC/ABAC)**      | Governance enforcement                |
| **Data Catalogs (e.g., Collibra, Alation)**       | Metadata and stewardship              |
| **Monitoring / SLA Dashboards**                   | Uptime, latency, and quality tracking |
| **Cost Tracking Tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer)** | Infrastructure audit & ROI analysis   |

## Career Alignment

Understanding executive priorities makes you a better data architect, analyst, or leader. These skills are essential for roles in data platform strategy, data governance, enterprise analytics, and technical product management—anywhere technology must align with business outcomes.
