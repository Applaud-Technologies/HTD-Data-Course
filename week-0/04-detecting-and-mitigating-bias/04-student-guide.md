# Student Guide: Detecting and Mitigating Bias

## Overview

This lesson equips engineers with the tools to identify and mitigate bias across the data pipeline—from collection through modeling. Bias isn't just a data issue—it's a system flaw that can impact real lives, especially in industries like finance, insurance, healthcare, and hiring. Understanding the taxonomy of bias and implementing fair systems is essential for building trustworthy AI solutions.

## Core Learning Outcomes (Simplified for Reference)

- Differentiate between cognitive, statistical, and algorithmic biases.
- Analyze datasets for sampling bias using statistical tests and population comparisons.
- Audit pipelines to detect measurement and processing bias.
- Apply fairness metrics to evaluate bias in ML models.
- Design multi-stage mitigation strategies using preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques.

## Core Concepts & Takeaways

### Bias Taxonomy

| Bias Type   | Analogous to       | Mitigation Strategy          |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Cognitive   | Requirements flaws | Diverse teams, bias training |
| Statistical | Sampling bug       | Representation testing       |
| Algorithmic | Logic flaw         | Fairness-aware modeling      |

Biases often cascade from one stage to another—address early and continuously.

### Sampling Bias Detection

- Use **chi-square**, **KS tests**, or **propensity scores**.
- Compare demographic distributions across data and population.
- Test for intersectionality (e.g., age × gender).
- Consider temporal and geographic sampling gaps.

### Measurement & Processing Bias

- Audit data transformations (cleaning, encoding, normalization).
- Track distribution shifts by group pre/post processing.
- Watch for proxy variables and missingness bias.
- Use `measure_preprocessing_impact()` to automate auditing.

### Fairness Metrics

| Metric             | Focus               |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Demographic Parity | Equal predictions   |
| Equal Opportunity  | Equal TP rates      |
| Equalized Odds     | Equal TP + FP rates |
| Predictive Parity  | Equal precision     |

Use appropriate metrics based on domain: e.g., criminal justice favors Equal Opportunity; marketing may prefer Demographic Parity.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Preprocessing**:

- Balanced sampling, reweighting, data augmentation
- Feature suppression or transformation
- Synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE, GANs)

**In-processing**:

- Adversarial debiasing
- Fairness-aware loss functions
- Learning fair representations

**Post-processing**:

- Group-specific threshold adjustment
- Calibration
- Reject option classification

Combine multiple stages for optimal fairness and accuracy.
