# Student Guide: Data Interpretation

## Overview

This lesson focuses on turning raw data into actionable insights through context-driven interpretation, pattern recognition, and storytelling. These skills are essential for junior engineers navigating analytical roles in regulated industries like insurance, finance, and fintech, where interpreting trends and presenting findings can directly influence business decisions.

## Core Learning Outcomes (Simplified for Reference)

- Apply contextual frameworks to evaluate and interpret raw data.
- Analyze patterns, trends, and correlations in datasets.
- Distinguish between statistical significance and practical impact.
- Integrate quantitative and qualitative data sources for better insight.
- Craft stakeholder-appropriate narratives from analytical findings.

| **Correlation**              | A statistical measure showing relationships between variables |
| **Statistical Significance** | Indicates observed effects are unlikely due to chance        |
| **Practical Significance**   | Real-world relevance of a statistically significant result   |
| **Outlier**                  | A data point that deviates significantly from others         |
| **Triangulation**            | Combining multiple data sources/methods to confirm insights  |
| **Data Storytelling**        | Structuring data into compelling narratives                  |
| **Audience Adaptation**      | Framing insights based on stakeholder priorities             |
| **Anomaly**                  | An unusual or unexpected data observation                    |
| **Qualitative Data**         | Descriptive, non-numerical data (e.g., interviews)           |
| **Quantitative Data**        | Numerical data used for statistical analysis                 |

## Core Concepts & Takeaways

### Evaluating Raw Data with Context

- Raw data needs **context** to gain meaning.
- Apply different frameworks (technical, business, UX) to extract insight.
- Always ask: Who created the data? What does it represent? What’s missing?

### Pattern Recognition

| Pattern Type | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Trends       | Long-term increases or decreases           |
| Cycles       | Recurring intervals (e.g., monthly)        |
| Seasonality  | Patterns tied to calendar (e.g., holidays) |
| Correlation  | Co-movement between variables              |
| Clusters     | Groups of similar data points              |

Use smoothing, regression, and visualizations to interpret trends.

### Statistical vs Practical Significance

- **Statistical Significance** (e.g., p < 0.05): unlikely by chance.
- **Practical Importance**: does the effect size matter in the real world?
- Don’t confuse technical anomalies with user-facing problems.

### Quantitative + Qualitative = Better Insights

- **Triangulation** = cross-checking metrics with feedback, tickets, interviews.
- Example: Slow API + user complaints + recent UI change = root cause.
- Combine breadth (quant) with depth (qual) for holistic insight.

### Data Storytelling & Stakeholder Communication

| Audience   | Focus                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Executives | Strategic impact                 |
| Developers | Technical root cause             |
| PMs        | User experience & features       |
| Customers  | Service quality and transparency |

Adapt depth, terminology, and recommendations to the stakeholder’s priorities.
