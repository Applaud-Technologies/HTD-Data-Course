# Quiz: Statistics for Interpreting Data

## Multiple Choice Questions

**Question 1:**  
Which measure of central tendency is most appropriate for analyzing response times in a system with occasional spikes?

a) Mean  
b) Median  
c) Mode  
d) Z-score  


**Question 2:**  
In a normal distribution, approximately what percentage of values fall within ±2 standard deviations of the mean?

a) 68%  
b) 95%  
c) 99.7%  
d) 50%  


**Question 3:**  
What is the primary distinction between correlation and causation?

a) Correlation is stronger than causation  
b) Causation is always indicated by strong correlation  
c) Correlation indicates variables change together; causation indicates one variable causes the other to change  
d) Correlation applies to continuous data while causation applies to discrete data  


**Question 4:**  
Which statistical method identifies outliers by finding values more than a certain number of standard deviations from the mean?

a) IQR method  
b) Z-score method  
c) DBSCAN  
d) Pearson coefficient  


**Question 5:**  
What is the correct formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient?

a) r = covariance(x,y) / (standard deviation of x × standard deviation of y)  
b) r = sum(x × y) / n  
c) r = sum(xi - mean_x) / n  
d) r = (upper quartile - lower quartile) / 2  


## Multiple Answer Questions

**Question 6:**  
Which of the following are characteristics of discrete data? (Select all that apply)

a) Consists of finite, countable values  
b) Can be subdivided into any fractional value  
c) Typically visualized using bar charts  
d) Examples include number of HTTP requests and server restarts 


**Question 7:**  
What are valid methods for establishing causation beyond correlation? (Select all that apply)
