# Student Guide: Statistics for Interpreting Data



## Overview

This lesson introduces essential statistical concepts that enable engineers to make sense of software system metrics, user behavior, and performance anomalies. Mastering these skills supports better system monitoring, troubleshooting, and decision-making—particularly in data-intensive industries like insurance, finance, and fintech.



## Core Learning Outcomes (Simplified for Reference)

- Apply statistical techniques to interpret discrete and continuous software metrics.
- Analyze distributions using measures of central tendency and variance.
- Evaluate the significance of findings through probability and sample space analysis.
- Detect and interpret trends, cycles, and anomalies in time-series data.
- Differentiate between correlation and causation to avoid flawed decision-making.



## Key Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Continuous Data** | Data that can take any value within a range (e.g., response time). |
| **Discrete Data** | Countable data with fixed values (e.g., error codes). |
| **Mean** | The arithmetic average of a set of numbers. |
| **Median** | The middle value in a sorted dataset. |
| **Mode** | The most frequently occurring value in a dataset. |
| **Variance** | The average of the squared differences from the mean. |
| **Standard Deviation** | The square root of variance, showing data spread. |
| **Z-score** | A standardized value representing the number of standard deviations from the mean. |
| **Sample Space** | All possible outcomes in a statistical experiment. |
| **Conditional Probability** | The likelihood of an event given that another has occurred. |
| **Bayes' Theorem** | A formula for reversing conditional probabilities. |
| **Trend** | Long-term directional movement in time-series data. |
| **Seasonality** | Predictable recurring patterns in time-series data. |
| **Outlier** | A data point significantly different from others in the dataset. |
| **Correlation Coefficient** | A value that quantifies the strength and direction of a relationship. |



## Core Concepts & Takeaways

### Understanding Data Types
- **Continuous vs. Discrete**: Choose statistical tools and visualizations based on whether your data is measured or counted.
- **Visualizations**: Use bar charts for discrete data and histograms for continuous data.



### Central Tendency & Variance

- Use **mean**, **median**, and **mode** strategically depending on data distribution.
- Calculate **variance** and **standard deviation** to understand spread.
- Use **z-scores** to detect anomalies and set alert thresholds.



### Probability & Sample Spaces

- Understand system states as sample spaces for modeling test coverage or fault tolerance.
- Use **conditional probability** and **Bayes' Theorem** to refine incident analysis.



### Analyzing Time-Series Data

- Identify **trends**, **seasonality**, and **cycles** to detect system changes.
- Use decomposition methods and correlation techniques to differentiate noise from signals.



### Outlier Detection

- Detect outliers using **z-score**, **IQR**, or machine learning methods like Isolation Forest.
- Interpret outliers in context—distinguish between anomalies, edge cases, and measurement errors.



### Correlation vs. Causation

- **Correlation** shows relationships; **causation** proves impact.
- Use **A/B testing**, temporal precedence, and experimental design to establish causality.



## Tools & Technologies Mentioned

| Tool / Language | Usage Context |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Python** | Used for statistical calculations and data visualization. |
| **matplotlib** | For generating bar charts and histograms. |
| **numpy** | For generating synthetic continuous data. |
| **DBSCAN** | A clustering algorithm for identifying outliers. |
| **Isolation Forest** | A machine learning technique for outlier detection. |
