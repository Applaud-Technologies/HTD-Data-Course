# Lesson: Data Collection & Sources

### Multiple Choice Questions

**Question 1:**  
What is the primary difference between primary and secondary data sources?

a) Primary data is always more accurate than secondary data  
b) Primary data is collected specifically for your analytical purpose, while secondary data was collected for other purposes  
c) Secondary data is always more comprehensive than primary data  
d) Primary data is free while secondary data must be purchased  

**Correct Answer:** **b) Primary data is collected specifically for your analytical purpose, while secondary data was collected for other purposes**  

**Explanation:**  
Primary data is collected directly for your specific analytical purpose (like your "first-party code"), giving you higher control but at higher costs. Secondary data was originally collected for other purposes but can be repurposed for your analysis, offering faster time-to-insight but with reduced control.


**Question 2:**  
Which data collection method is most similar to parsing unstructured text files in software development?

a) API Integrations  
b) Sensor Networks  
c) Web Scraping  
d) Database Extracts  

**Correct Answer:** **c) Web Scraping**  

**Explanation:**  
Web scraping involves automated extraction of data from websites, which is similar to parsing unstructured text files in software development. Both processes transform human-readable content into machine-readable data through automated extraction and structuring techniques.


**Question 3:**  
Which sampling technique divides the population into subgroups (strata) with elements selected from each?

a) Random Sampling  
b) Stratified Sampling  
c) Cluster Sampling  
d) Systematic Sampling  

**Correct Answer:** **b) Stratified Sampling**  

**Explanation:**  
Stratified sampling divides the population into subgroups (strata) and selects elements from each group. This is similar to ensuring test coverage across different components in software testing, guaranteeing representation from all critical segments.


**Question 4:**  
What data quality dimension measures whether your dataset includes all required elements?

a) Accuracy  
b) Consistency  
c) Completeness  
d) Validity  

**Correct Answer:** **c) Completeness**  

**Explanation:**  
Completeness measures whether all necessary data points are present in your dataset. This is similar to test coverage in software development, assessing whether your dataset includes all the required elements for proper analysis.


**Question 5:**  
Which type of data structure is most appropriate for analyzing complex relationships between entities?

a) Structured data in relational databases  
b) Semi-structured data in JSON format  
c) Unstructured data like text documents  
d) Graph data structures  

**Correct Answer:** **d) Graph data structures**  

**Explanation:**  
Graph data structures focus on relationships between entities, making them ideal for analyzing complex relationships like social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems. They excel at relationship traversal and network analysis, similar to object reference graphs in memory.


### Multiple Answer Questions

**Question 6:**  
Which of the following are common biases in data collection? (Select all that apply)

a) Selection Bias  
b) Confirmation Bias  
c) Temporal Bias  
d) Statistical Bias  

**Correct Answers:**  
**a) Selection Bias**  
**b) Confirmation Bias**  
**c) Temporal Bias**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Selection Bias** occurs when the sampled population doesn't represent the target population.
- **Confirmation Bias** happens when collection methods are unconsciously designed to reinforce existing assumptions.
- **Temporal Bias** exists when data collected at specific times may not represent other time periods.
- **Statistical Bias** is not specifically mentioned in the lesson as a common bias type.


**Question 7:**  
Which dimensions should be considered when assessing data quality? (Select all that apply)

a) Accuracy  
b) Completeness  
c) Timeliness  
d) Price  

**Correct Answers:**  
**a) Accuracy**  
**b) Completeness**  
**c) Timeliness**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Accuracy** measures whether data correctly represents reality, similar to correctness in algorithms.
- **Completeness** assesses whether all necessary data points are present, like test coverage.
- **Timeliness** evaluates whether data is current enough for its intended use, similar to caching considerations.
- **Price** is not a dimension of data quality assessment mentioned in the lesson.


**Question 8:**  
Which sampling techniques are described in the lesson? (Select all that apply)

a) Random Sampling  
b) Stratified Sampling  
c) Cluster Sampling  
d) Probability Sampling  

**Correct Answers:**  
**a) Random Sampling**  
**b) Stratified Sampling**  
**c) Cluster Sampling**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Random Sampling** gives every element an equal probability of selection.
- **Stratified Sampling** divides the population into subgroups with elements selected from each.
- **Cluster Sampling** randomly selects groups, then includes all elements within chosen clusters.
- **Probability Sampling** is not specifically mentioned as one of the four primary sampling approaches in the lesson.


**Question 9:**  
Which of the following are data collection methods mentioned in the lesson? (Select all that apply)

a) Surveys and Questionnaires  
b) API Integrations  
c) Sensor Networks  
d) DNA Sequencing  

**Correct Answers:**  
**a) Surveys and Questionnaires**  
**b) API Integrations**  
**c) Sensor Networks**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Surveys and Questionnaires** provide structured human feedback, similar to form inputs in web applications.
- **API Integrations** offer programmatic access to structured data from external systems.
- **Sensor Networks** consist of IoT devices collecting environmental measurements.
- **DNA Sequencing** is not mentioned in the lesson as a data collection method.


**Question 10:**  
Which of the following data structure types are discussed in the lesson? (Select all that apply)

a) Structured Data  
b) Semi-structured Data  
c) Unstructured Data  
d) Binary Data  

**Correct Answers:**  
**a) Structured Data**  
**b) Semi-structured Data**  
**c) Unstructured Data**  

**Explanation:**  
- **Structured Data** is organized in rigid, predefined formats with consistent fields and relationships.
- **Semi-structured Data** contains organizational markers but allows flexibility in structure.
- **Unstructured Data** has no predefined format or organization.
- **Binary Data** is not specifically identified as one of the main data structure types in the lesson.
