# Data Validation and Quality Checks

## Introduction

Data validation in engineering pipelines resembles input validation in web applicationsâ€”but with organization-wide consequences. As a software developer, you've already built input validation into your applications to protect against corrupt data. However, data engineering elevates these validation skills from guarding single applications to safeguarding enterprise-wide decision systems. When your validation code catches an issue in an application, it might prevent a single transaction error; when your data pipeline validation identifies problems, it could prevent an entire business strategy from being built on faulty information. 

This lesson translates your existing validation experience into the SQL-based techniques that data engineers use to implement integrity checks, validate business rules, and ensure data quality throughout transformation workflows. Let's explore how these validation practices help you deliver trustworthy data assets that businesses can confidently use for critical decisions.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Implement fundamental data validation checks in SQL workflows including integrity constraints, error detection mechanisms, and validation checkpoint integration.
2. Apply data profiling techniques to identify quality issues through statistical analysis, pattern validation, and consistency checks across datasets.
3. Compare validation approaches for different pipeline contexts by evaluating source-to-target reconciliation strategies, real-time vs. batch validation tradeoffs, and performance considerations.

## Implementing Fundamental Data Validation Checks

### Basic Integrity Validation in SQL

Just as you've used constraints in your Java database applications, data engineers need to verify that data follows key integrity rules. The difference is that you'll often be working with already-loaded data where constraint violations need to be detected rather than prevented.

#### Row Count Reconciliation

The simplest validation check is comparing record counts between source and target tables. This helps you quickly verify if all expected records were processed.

```sql
-- Basic row count validation between source and target
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table) AS source_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_fact_table) AS target_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_fact_table)
        THEN 'PASSED' 
        ELSE 'FAILED' 
    END AS validation_result;
```

In job interviews, you might be asked how you ensure data completeness. This simple technique shows you understand the fundamental validation concept of reconciliation.

#### Referential Integrity Validation

In dimensional models, every foreign key in your fact table should have a matching primary key in your dimension tables. Here's how to check for orphaned records:

```sql
-- Find fact records with missing dimension references
SELECT f.order_key, f.customer_key 
FROM fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN dim_customer d ON f.customer_key = d.customer_key
WHERE d.customer_key IS NULL;
```

This type of validation is especially important in star schemas where referential integrity might not be enforced by foreign key constraints for performance reasons.

#### Null Checks for Required Fields

Identifying missing values in critical fields helps prevent downstream analysis issues:

```sql
-- Check for nulls in required fields
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN product_key IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_product,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quantity IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_quantity
FROM fact_sales;
```

When interviewing for data engineering roles, employers want to see that you proactively check for data completeness rather than letting NULL values cause problems in reports or models.

### Business Rule Validation Techniques

In your Java applications, you've validated that user inputs match business requirements. In data engineering, you'll apply similar thinking to validate that data follows business rules.

#### Range and Boundary Validation

Business data typically has expected ranges. Values outside these ranges may indicate data quality issues:

```sql
-- Validate numerical values are within expected ranges
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS invalid_quantity,
    SUM(CASE WHEN unit_price < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS negative_price,
    SUM(CASE WHEN discount > 1.0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS excessive_discount
FROM fact_sales;
```

Companies value engineers who can translate business rules into technical validations. This skill bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.

#### Category and Domain Validation

For dimension attributes, you often need to verify values belong to an expected set:

```sql
-- Validate category values match expected domains
SELECT 
    product_category,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM dim_product
WHERE product_category NOT IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home', 'Sports', 'Books')
GROUP BY product_category;
```

This validation approach helps identify data that doesn't conform to business categories, which could break downstream reports or analyses.

#### Date and Time Coherence Checks

Time-based validations are crucial for fact tables that track events or transactions:

```sql
-- Check for date logic issues
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_date > ship_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS shipped_before_ordered,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_date > GETDATE() THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS future_dated_orders
FROM fact_sales;
```

Hiring managers often ask about experience with temporal data validation because date/time issues can significantly impact business analysis.

### Error Detection and Reporting Implementation

While Java applications typically throw exceptions when validation fails, data pipelines need to capture and report validation errors without stopping the entire process.

#### Structured Validation Result Tables

Creating a dedicated table for validation results helps track data quality over time:

```sql
-- Create a validation results table
CREATE TABLE validation_results (
    validation_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    validation_name VARCHAR(100),
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    validation_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    record_count INT,
    failed_count INT,
    validation_status VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Insert validation results
INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
SELECT 
    'Price Range Check',
    'fact_sales',
    COUNT(*),
    SUM(CASE WHEN unit_price < 0 OR unit_price > 10000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN unit_price < 0 OR unit_price > 10000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 
        THEN 'PASSED' 
        ELSE 'FAILED' 
    END
FROM fact_sales;
```

In production environments, data engineers are expected to build validation frameworks that track results over time and enable trend analysis of data quality.

#### Error Categorization and Prioritization

Not all validation failures are equally important. Categorizing issues helps teams focus on the most critical problems:

```sql
-- Categorize validation issues by severity
SELECT 
    'Critical' AS severity,
    'Referential Integrity' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS issue_count
FROM fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN dim_customer d ON f.customer_key = d.customer_key
WHERE d.customer_key IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Warning' AS severity,
    'Unusual Values' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS issue_count
FROM fact_sales
WHERE quantity > 100;
```

Being able to prioritize data quality issues demonstrates business understanding and will help you work effectively with data consumers.

#### Exception Tables for Rejected Records

For serious validation failures, storing the rejected records helps with investigation:

```sql
-- Store records that fail validation
SELECT *
INTO rejected_sales_records
FROM fact_sales
WHERE unit_price < 0 OR quantity <= 0;
```

Companies often look for data engineers who don't just identify problems but also create systems that facilitate problem resolution.

## Applying Data Profiling Techniques

Data profiling means examining your data to understand its content, structure, and quality. This is similar to how you might inspect data structures in Java, but with a focus on the actual data values rather than just types.

### Statistical Analysis for Outlier Detection

You've used aggregation functions in basic SQL queries. For data quality, these same functions help identify potential issues.

#### Basic Statistical Profiling

Start with simple measures to understand your data distribution:

```sql
-- Basic statistical profiling
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS record_count,
    MIN(quantity) AS min_quantity,
    MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity,
    AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity,
    STDEV(quantity) AS stddev_quantity
FROM fact_sales;
```

This provides a quick summary that helps you spot potential issues - extremely high maximums or unusual averages might indicate data problems.

#### Outlier Detection Using Standard Deviation

Identify values that fall outside the expected range:

```sql
-- Find outliers using standard deviation
WITH stats AS (
    SELECT 
        AVG(unit_price) AS avg_price,
        STDEV(unit_price) AS stddev_price
    FROM fact_sales
)
SELECT 
    order_key,
    product_key,
    unit_price
FROM fact_sales, stats
WHERE unit_price > avg_price + 3 * stddev_price  -- 3 sigma rule
   OR unit_price < avg_price - 3 * stddev_price;
```

During interviews, being able to explain how you identify outliers shows you understand not just SQL syntax but how to apply it for data quality.

#### Time Series Pattern Analysis

For fact tables with date dimensions, look for unusual patterns over time:

```sql
-- Check for unusual daily patterns
SELECT 
    CAST(order_date AS DATE) AS order_day,
    COUNT(*) AS daily_orders,
    SUM(quantity) AS daily_quantity
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY CAST(order_date AS DATE)
ORDER BY daily_orders DESC;
```

Many data engineering roles require monitoring data patterns over time, so demonstrating this skill is valuable in interviews.

### Pattern and Value Frequency Analysis

Just as you might validate string patterns in Java, data engineers need to validate patterns in data.

#### Pattern Matching for Data Formats

Check if values conform to expected formats:

```sql
-- Validate phone number format
SELECT 
    phone_number,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM dim_customer
WHERE phone_number NOT LIKE '[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'
GROUP BY phone_number;
```

Format validation is especially important for dimension tables that feed into reports or dashboards where inconsistent formatting can create confusion.

#### Frequency Analysis for Categorical Data

Understanding value distributions helps identify unusual patterns:

```sql
-- Analyze value distribution in categorical fields
SELECT 
    product_category,
    COUNT(*) AS category_count,
    CAST(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS percentage
FROM dim_product
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY category_count DESC;
```

In interviews, showing you know how to profile categorical data demonstrates your ability to understand the data you're working with.

#### Unexpected Value Detection

Identify values that don't match business expectations:

```sql
-- Find unusual values in description fields
SELECT 
    LEFT(product_description, 50) AS truncated_description,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM dim_product
WHERE product_description LIKE '%test%'
   OR product_description LIKE '%dummy%'
   OR product_description LIKE '%placeholder%'
GROUP BY LEFT(product_description, 50);
```

Finding test data that accidentally made it to production is a common task for data engineers. This skill shows attention to detail that employers value.

### Completeness and Consistency Verification

Beyond individual fields, data engineers need to validate relationships and consistency across tables.

#### Orphaned Records Detection

Find records in one table that don't have required relationships:

```sql
-- Find orphaned dimension records
SELECT 
    d.product_key,
    d.product_name
FROM dim_product d
LEFT JOIN fact_sales f ON d.product_key = f.product_key
WHERE f.product_key IS NULL;
```

This helps identify unused dimension records, which might indicate process issues in your data pipeline.

#### Duplicate Key Identification

Find unexpected duplicates that could cause aggregation issues:

```sql
-- Identify duplicate keys in dimension tables
SELECT 
    product_key,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM dim_product
GROUP BY product_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

Dealing with duplicate keys is a common interview question for data engineering positions, as it impacts data integrity.

#### Cross-Field Consistency Checks

Validate that related fields are consistent with each other:

```sql
-- Check consistency between related fields
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    SUM(CASE WHEN total_amount != quantity * unit_price * (1 - discount) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS inconsistent_records
FROM fact_sales;
```

This type of validation catches calculation errors that might be hard to detect through other means. Demonstrating this skill shows your thoroughness in validating data.

## Comparing Validation Approaches

Different validation techniques work better in different contexts. Understanding these tradeoffs is key to effective data engineering.

### Source-to-Target Reconciliation Strategies

In Java applications, you might verify data after database operations. In data engineering, you need to verify data as it moves between systems.

#### Hash-Based Comparison

Using hashes helps compare data across systems efficiently:

```sql
-- Compare records using hash values
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    SUM(CASE WHEN HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', CONCAT(s.customer_id, s.customer_name)) = 
                HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', CONCAT(t.customer_key, t.customer_name))
              THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matching_records
FROM source_customer s
JOIN dim_customer t ON s.customer_id = t.customer_key;
```

This technique is valuable when comparing large datasets where row-by-row comparison would be too expensive.

#### Sampling for Large Datasets

For very large tables, sampling provides a practical validation approach:

```sql
-- Validate a random sample of records
SELECT TOP 1000 
    s.order_id,
    s.order_amount,
    t.order_key,
    t.order_amount
FROM source_orders s
JOIN fact_sales t ON s.order_id = t.order_key
ORDER BY NEWID();  -- Random sampling
```

In interviews, explaining when to use sampling shows you understand practical constraints in real-world data environments.

#### Checksum Validation for Aggregates

Compare aggregated values rather than individual records:

```sql
-- Compare source and target aggregates
SELECT 
    'Daily Totals' AS validation_check,
    s.order_date,
    SUM(s.amount) AS source_total,
    SUM(t.order_amount) AS target_total,
    CASE 
        WHEN ABS(SUM(s.amount) - SUM(t.order_amount)) < 0.01 THEN 'MATCH'
        ELSE 'MISMATCH'
    END AS result
FROM source_orders s
JOIN fact_sales t ON s.order_id = t.order_key
GROUP BY s.order_date;
```

This approach works well for validating transformed data where individual records might not match exactly but aggregates should.

### Real-time vs. Batch Validation Tradeoffs

Just as you choose different validation approaches in your Java applications based on performance needs, data validation timing requires careful consideration.

#### Inline Validation During Transformation

Validating data as it's transformed catches issues immediately:

```sql
-- Inline validation during insert
INSERT INTO fact_sales
SELECT 
    s.order_id,
    s.customer_id,
    s.product_id,
    s.order_date,
    s.quantity,
    s.unit_price,
    s.quantity * s.unit_price AS total_amount
FROM source_orders s
JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_key  -- Validates customer exists
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_id = p.product_key     -- Validates product exists
WHERE s.quantity > 0                                   -- Validates positive quantity
  AND s.unit_price >= 0;                               -- Validates non-negative price
```

This approach prevents invalid data from entering your target system but may slow down the transformation process.

#### Post-Load Validation Batch Jobs

Running validation after data is loaded allows for more comprehensive checks:

```sql
-- Post-load validation stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE ValidateFactSales
AS
BEGIN
    -- Check for referential integrity
    INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
    SELECT 
        'Customer Reference Check',
        'fact_sales',
        COUNT(*),
        SUM(CASE WHEN c.customer_key IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN c.customer_key IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'PASSED' ELSE 'FAILED' END
    FROM fact_sales f
    LEFT JOIN dim_customer c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key;
    
    -- Check for valid quantities
    INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
    SELECT 
        'Quantity Check',
        'fact_sales',
        COUNT(*),
        SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'PASSED' ELSE 'FAILED' END
    FROM fact_sales;
END;
```

This approach provides more thorough validation without slowing the initial data load.

#### Checkpoint-Based Validation

Validate at key points in your pipeline to catch issues early while maintaining performance:

```sql
-- Checkpoint validation after staging but before final load
-- First, validate staging data
EXEC ValidateStagingData;

-- If validation passes, proceed with final load
IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM validation_results 
    WHERE validation_name LIKE 'Staging%' 
    AND validation_status = 'FAILED'
    AND validation_date > DATEADD(HOUR, -1, GETDATE())) = 0
BEGIN
    -- Load data from staging to final tables
    EXEC LoadFromStagingToFinal;
    
    -- Then validate final data
    EXEC ValidateFinalData;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    -- Log validation failure
    INSERT INTO pipeline_log (log_message, log_level)
    VALUES ('Staging validation failed, aborting load', 'ERROR');
END
```

This approach balances performance and data quality by validating at strategic points. It's an approach that experienced data engineers use in production pipelines.

### Performance-Optimized Validation

As you've optimized Java code for performance, data validation must also be optimized for large datasets.

#### Indexing Strategies for Validation Queries

Proper indexing makes validation queries run faster:

```sql
-- Create index to support validation queries
CREATE INDEX idx_fact_sales_customer_key ON fact_sales(customer_key);
CREATE INDEX idx_fact_sales_product_key ON fact_sales(product_key);

-- Validation query that will use indexes
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS orphaned_records
FROM fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN dim_customer c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key
WHERE c.customer_key IS NULL;
```

Understanding how to optimize validation queries shows you can build processes that scale with data volume.

#### Sampling Approaches for Initial Validation

For quick checks, validate a sample before processing the full dataset:

```sql
-- Quick validation on sample before full validation
IF (SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM (SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM staging_sales ORDER BY NEWID()) s
    LEFT JOIN dim_customer c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_key
    WHERE c.customer_key IS NULL) > 0
BEGIN
    -- Log potential referential integrity issue
    INSERT INTO validation_log (validation_type, message)
    VALUES ('Sample Check', 'Potential missing customer references detected in sample');
END
```

This technique helps you catch obvious issues quickly without waiting for full validation to complete.

#### Incremental Validation Techniques

For tables that change frequently, validate only the new or changed data:

```sql
-- Validate only new data since last validation
DECLARE @last_validation DATETIME = (
    SELECT MAX(validation_date) 
    FROM validation_results 
    WHERE validation_name = 'Daily Sales Validation'
);

-- Validate only records newer than last validation
INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
SELECT 
    'Daily Sales Validation',
    'fact_sales',
    COUNT(*),
    SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 OR unit_price < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
    CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 OR unit_price < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'PASSED' ELSE 'FAILED' END
FROM fact_sales
WHERE load_date > @last_validation;
```

This approach focuses validation efforts on new data, which is more efficient for ongoing validation in production pipelines.

## Hands-On Practice: Building a Validation Framework

Let's apply what you've learned by building a simple validation framework for a star schema. This exercise will help you develop skills that employers look for in entry-level data engineers.

### Step 1: Create Validation Results Table

First, create a table to store validation results:

```sql
CREATE TABLE validation_results (
    validation_id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    validation_name VARCHAR(100),
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    validation_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    record_count INT,
    failed_count INT,
    validation_status VARCHAR(20)
);
```

### Step 2: Implement Basic Validation Stored Procedure

Next, create a stored procedure that runs common validation checks:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ValidateDimensionalModel
AS
BEGIN
    -- Clear previous results from today
    DELETE FROM validation_results 
    WHERE CAST(validation_date AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE);
    
    -- Check referential integrity
    INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
    SELECT 
        'Customer Reference Check',
        'fact_sales',
        COUNT(*),
        SUM(CASE WHEN c.customer_key IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN c.customer_key IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'PASSED' ELSE 'FAILED' END
    FROM fact_sales f
    LEFT JOIN dim_customer c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key;
    
    -- Check for valid quantities
    INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
    SELECT 
        'Quantity Check',
        'fact_sales',
        COUNT(*),
        SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN quantity <= 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'PASSED' ELSE 'FAILED' END
    FROM fact_sales;
    
    -- Check for date consistency
    INSERT INTO validation_results (validation_name, table_name, record_count, failed_count, validation_status)
    SELECT 
        'Date Consistency Check',
        'fact_sales',
        COUNT(*),
        SUM(CASE WHEN order_date > ship_date OR order_date > GETDATE() THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
        CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN order_date > ship_date OR order_date > GETDATE() THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'PASSED' ELSE 'FAILED' END
    FROM fact_sales;
END;
```

### Step 3: Create a Validation Report

Finally, create a query to report on validation results:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetValidationSummary
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        validation_date,
        table_name,
        SUM(CASE WHEN validation_status = 'PASSED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS passed_checks,
        SUM(CASE WHEN validation_status = 'FAILED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_checks,
        SUM(failed_count) AS total_failed_records
    FROM validation_results
    GROUP BY validation_date, table_name
    ORDER BY validation_date DESC, table_name;
    
    -- Show detailed failures for today
    SELECT 
        validation_name,
        table_name,
        failed_count,
        validation_status
    FROM validation_results
    WHERE validation_status = 'FAILED'
      AND CAST(validation_date AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
    ORDER BY failed_count DESC;
END;
```

This exercise gives you a practical framework you can demonstrate in interviews when asked about data validation approaches. It shows you understand not just how to write individual validation checks but how to build a systematic approach to data quality.

## Conclusion

Data validation serves as the immune system for your data pipelines, detecting and addressing quality issues before they can impact business decisions. Through this lesson, you've expanded your validation toolkit with SQL techniques for integrity checking, data profiling, and systematic quality managementâ€”skills that directly align with what employers seek in data engineering candidates. 

You now understand how to implement checks that validate referential integrity, apply statistical analysis to detect outliers, and build frameworks that balance validation thoroughness with performance requirements. When discussing your data engineering capabilities in interviews, emphasize your approach to validation as evidence of your commitment to data trustworthiness. As we move into our next lesson on data dictionaries and visualization, you'll learn how proper documentation complements validation by ensuring everyone understands what the data represents and how it should be interpreted.

# Glossary

## Core Data Validation Concepts

**Data Validation** The process of checking data accuracy, completeness, and consistency against predefined rules and business requirements. In data engineering, validation ensures that data meets quality standards before being used for analysis or decision-making.

**Data Quality** A measure of how well data serves its intended purpose, typically evaluated across dimensions including accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.

**Data Integrity** The maintenance of data accuracy and consistency throughout its lifecycle, ensuring that data remains trustworthy and hasn't been corrupted during processing or storage.

**Validation Rules** Specific criteria or conditions that data must meet to be considered valid. These rules can be technical (data types, formats) or business-related (value ranges, logical relationships).

**Data Profiling** The process of examining data to understand its structure, content, quality, and relationships. Profiling helps identify patterns, anomalies, and potential quality issues.

**Data Cleansing** The process of identifying and correcting or removing corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant data from datasets to improve data quality.

**Data Quality Framework** A structured approach to managing data quality that includes standards, processes, tools, and governance practices to ensure consistent data quality across an organization.

## Integrity Validation Types

**Referential Integrity** Ensures that relationships between tables remain valid, meaning foreign key values in one table have corresponding primary key values in the referenced table.

**Domain Integrity** Validates that data values fall within acceptable ranges or belong to predefined sets of valid values (e.g., status codes, categories).

**Entity Integrity** Ensures that each row in a table can be uniquely identified, typically through primary key constraints that prevent duplicate or null values.

**Business Rule Integrity** Validates that data conforms to specific business logic and constraints that may not be enforced at the database level.

**Temporal Integrity** Ensures that date and time values are logically consistent (e.g., start dates before end dates, no future dates where inappropriate).

**Completeness Integrity** Validates that required fields contain values and that expected records are present in datasets.

## Statistical Analysis Terms

**Outlier Detection** The process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected pattern or normal distribution of values in a dataset.

**Standard Deviation** A measure of variability that indicates how spread out data values are from the mean. Used in validation to identify values outside expected ranges.

**Three Sigma Rule** A statistical principle stating that approximately 99.7% of values in a normal distribution fall within three standard deviations of the mean. Values outside this range are considered potential outliers.

**Percentile Analysis** Statistical analysis that divides data into 100 equal parts, helping identify extreme values and understand data distribution patterns.

**Frequency Distribution** Analysis of how often different values appear in a dataset, useful for identifying unusual patterns or unexpected value concentrations.

**Statistical Profiling** The use of statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to understand data characteristics and identify potential quality issues.

**Variance Analysis** Measurement of how much data values differ from the average, helping identify datasets with unusual variability that may indicate quality problems.

## Data Quality Dimensions

**Accuracy** The degree to which data correctly represents the real-world entity or event it describes. Measured by comparing data against authoritative sources or known correct values.

**Completeness** The extent to which all required data is present and no values are missing. Can be measured at field, record, or dataset levels.

**Consistency** The degree to which data maintains the same format, structure, and meaning across different systems, databases, or time periods.

**Timeliness** How current and up-to-date data is relative to when it was created or when it's needed for decision-making purposes.

**Validity** The extent to which data conforms to defined formats, patterns, and business rules. Includes syntax validation and semantic validation.

**Uniqueness** The absence of duplicate records or values where duplicates are not expected or permitted.

**Precision** The level of detail and exactness in data values, including the number of decimal places or the granularity of measurements.

## Validation Methodologies

**Inline Validation** Data validation that occurs during the data transformation or loading process, preventing invalid data from entering target systems.

**Batch Validation** Validation processes that run on complete datasets after data has been loaded, providing comprehensive quality assessment.

# Data Validation and Quality Checks - Progressive Exercises

## Exercise 1: Basic Data Integrity Validation (Beginner)

**Learning Objective:** Master fundamental integrity checks similar to input validation in Java applications, but applied to data warehouses and dimensional models.

### Scenario
You're working for an e-commerce company that just migrated their sales data to a new dimensional model. The business team is concerned about data quality after the migration, and you need to implement basic validation checks to ensure the star schema has complete and consistent data.

### Sample Data Setup
```sql
-- Create dimension tables
CREATE TABLE dim_customer (
    customer_key INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    state VARCHAR(2),
    registration_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE dim_product (
    product_key INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    brand VARCHAR(50),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    is_active BIT DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE dim_date (
    date_key INT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_date DATE NOT NULL,
    year_number INT,
    month_number INT,
    day_number INT,
    day_name VARCHAR(10),

    date_key INT,
    order_id VARCHAR(20),
    quantity INT,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    discount_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Insert sample data with some quality issues
INSERT INTO dim_customer VALUES
(1, 'CUST001', 'John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@email.com', '555-0101', 'New York', 'NY', '2023-01-15'),
(2, 'CUST002', 'Jane', NULL, 'jane.doe@email.com', '555-0102', 'Los Angeles', 'CA', '2023-02-20'),

(2, 'PROD002', 'Headphones', 'Electronics', 'AudioBrand', 79.99, 1),
(3, 'PROD003', NULL, 'Books', 'PublishCorp', 24.99, 1); -- Missing product name

INSERT INTO dim_date VALUES
(20230115, '2023-01-15', 2023, 1, 15, 'Sunday', 'January'),
(20230220, '2023-02-20', 2023, 2, 20, 'Monday', 'February'),
(20230310, '2023-03-10', 2023, 3, 10, 'Friday', 'March');

INSERT INTO fact_sales VALUES
(1, 1, 20230115, 'ORD001', 2, 999.99, 50.00, 1949.98),
(2, 2, 20230220, 'ORD002', 1, 79.99, 0.00, 79.99),
(4, 1, 20230310, 'ORD003', 1, 999.99, 0.00, 999.99), -- Orphaned customer_key
(1, 5, 20230115, 'ORD004', 3, 24.99, 0.00, 74.97); -- Orphaned product_key
```

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Row Count Reconciliation**
Write queries to verify that the expected number of records exist in each table and compare against business expectations. Create a summary showing record counts for all tables.

**Task 2: Referential Integrity Validation**

Find missing values in critical fields that should always be populated:
- Required customer information (names, email)
- Required product information (names, categories)
- Required sales information (quantities, amounts)

### Expected Outcomes
- Clear understanding of data completeness across all tables
- Identification of referential integrity violations
- Documentation of missing critical data values
- Foundation for more advanced validation techniques

### Success Criteria
- All row count discrepancies are identified and documented

## Exercise 2: Business Rule Validation Implementation (Beginner-Intermediate)

**Learning Objective:** Implement business logic validation similar to form validation in web applications, but adapted for data warehouse business rules and constraints.

### Scenario
Your e-commerce company has specific business rules that need to be enforced in the data warehouse. The business analyst has provided you with a list of validation rules that reflect real-world constraints and help identify problematic data that could impact analytics and reporting.

### Enhanced Sample Data Setup
```sql
-- Add more sample data with business rule violations
INSERT INTO dim_customer VALUES
(4, 'CUST004', 'Test', 'User', 'invalid-email', '123', 'TestCity', 'XX', '2025-01-01'), -- Future date, invalid email, invalid state
(5, 'CUST005', 'Alice', 'Wonder', 'alice@valid.com', '555-0105', 'Boston', 'MA', '1900-01-01'); -- Very old date

INSERT INTO dim_product VALUES
(4, 'PROD004', 'Expensive Item', 'Luxury', 'PremiumBrand', -50.00, 1), -- Negative price
(5, 'PROD005', 'Test Product', 'InvalidCategory', 'TestBrand', 50000.00, 1); -- Invalid category, extreme price

INSERT INTO fact_sales VALUES
(1, 1, 20230115, 'ORD005', -2, 999.99, 0.00, -1999.98), -- Negative quantity
(2, 2, 20230220, 'ORD006', 0, 79.99, 0.00, 0.00), -- Zero quantity
(1, 2, 20230310, 'ORD007', 1, 79.99, 100.00, -20.01), -- Discount > price
(3, 1, 20230115, 'ORD008', 1, 999.99, 0.00, 500.00); -- Total != quantity * unit_price
```

### Business Rules to Validate

3. **Sales Rules:**
   - Quantities must be positive integers
   - Unit prices must match dimension table prices
   - Discounts cannot exceed unit price
   - Total amount should equal (quantity Ã— unit_price) - discount

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Implement Customer Validation Rules**
Create validation queries for each customer business rule:

    WHERE DATEADD(DAY, 1, date_value) <= @EndDate
)
INSERT INTO dim_date (date_key, full_date, year_number, month_number, day_number, day_name, month_name)
SELECT 
    YEAR(date_value) * 10000 + MONTH(date_value) * 100 + DAY(date_value),
    date_value,
    YEAR(date_value),
    MONTH(date_value),
    DAY(date_value),
    DATENAME(WEEKDAY, date_value),
    DATENAME(MONTH, date_value)
FROM DateGenerator
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 400);

-- Insert customers with varied registration patterns
INSERT INTO dim_customer (customer_key, customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, city, state, registration_date)
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY NEWID()) + 10,
    'CUST' + RIGHT('000' + CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY NEWID()) + 10 AS VARCHAR), 3),

        ELSE 'AZ'
    END,
    DATEADD(DAY, -ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 1000, GETDATE())
FROM sys.objects
WHERE ROWCOUNT < 50; -- Generate 50 customers

-- Create sales data with statistical variations and outliers
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;
WHILE @Counter <= 1000
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO fact_sales (customer_key, product_key, date_key, order_id, quantity, unit_price, discount_amount, total_amount)
    VALUES (

        'ORD' + RIGHT('00000' + CAST(@Counter + 1000 AS VARCHAR), 5),
        CASE 
            WHEN @Counter % 100 = 0 THEN 500  -- 1% outliers: very high quantity
            WHEN @Counter % 50 = 0 THEN 0     -- 2% outliers: zero quantity  
            ELSE (ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 5) + 1  -- Normal: 1-5 quantity
        END,
        CASE 
            WHEN @Counter % 75 = 0 THEN 9999.99  -- Occasional very high price
            ELSE 50 + (ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 200)  -- Normal: $50-$250
        END,
        CASE 
            WHEN @Counter % 10 = 0 THEN 10.00  -- 10% get discount
            ELSE 0.00
        END,
        0  -- Will calculate this properly in the query
    );
    
    SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;
END;

-- Update total_amount with calculated values (with some intentional errors)
UPDATE fact_sales 
SET total_amount = (quantity * unit_price) - discount_amount
WHERE sales_key > 1000;

-- Introduce some calculation errors (5% of records)

## Exercise 5: Performance-Optimized Validation at Scale (Advanced)

**Learning Objective:** Optimize validation processes for enterprise-scale data volumes, similar to optimizing application performance for high-traffic systems, but focused on data validation efficiency and resource management.

### Scenario
Your validation framework is successful, but as data volumes have grown to millions of records daily, validation is becoming a performance bottleneck. You need to optimize validation processes to handle large-scale data while maintaining thoroughness and accuracy. The business requires validation to complete within 30-minute windows without impacting other system operations.

### Large-Scale Data Setup
```sql
-- Create partitioned tables for better performance
CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION pf_sales_date (INT)
AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES (20230101, 20230201, 20230301, 20230401, 20230501, 20230601, 20230701, 20230801, 20230901, 20231001, 20231101, 20231201);

CREATE PARTITION SCHEME ps_sales_date
AS PARTITION pf_sales_date ALL TO ([PRIMARY]);

-- Create large fact table with partitioning

    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    rule_category VARCHAR(50),
    sample_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    min_sample_size INT,
    max_sample_size INT,
    sampling_method VARCHAR(20), -- RANDOM, SYSTEMATIC, STRATIFIED
    confidence_level DECIMAL(3,2),
    is_active BIT DEFAULT 1
);

-- Insert sample performance configurations
INSERT INTO validation_sampling_config (table_name, rule_category, sample_percentage, min_sample_size, max_sample_size, sampling_method, confidence_level)
VALUES
('fact_sales_large', 'INTEGRITY', 10.0, 1000, 100000, 'RANDOM', 0.95),
('fact_sales_large', 'BUSINESS', 5.0, 500, 50000, 'STRATIFIED', 0.90),
('fact_sales_large', 'STATISTICAL', 1.0, 1000, 10000, 'SYSTEMATIC', 0.85);
