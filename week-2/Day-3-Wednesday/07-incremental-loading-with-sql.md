# Incremental Loading with SQL

## Introduction

Just as you wouldn't rebuild an entire application every time you change a single function, efficient data engineers don't reload entire data warehouses when only a fraction of the data has changed. Incremental loading—the practice of processing only what's new or modified—is a critical skill that separates entry-level data pipelines from production-grade systems. When working with millions of records, this approach can transform processing that takes hours into jobs that complete in minutes. 

Companies evaluating data engineering candidates specifically look for experience with these patterns, as they directly impact infrastructure costs, data freshness, and system reliability. The techniques you'll learn in this lesson represent real-world practices that scale from gigabytes to petabytes, giving you practical skills to implement in your next data engineering project.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Implement merge/upsert patterns for dimensional data warehouses using SQL MERGE statements, conflict resolution strategies, and transaction management to maintain data consistency.
2. Apply watermark-based incremental loading strategies by implementing delta detection with timestamps or sequence identifiers and managing historical data states during change data capture workflows.
3. Evaluate performance tradeoffs between full refresh and incremental loading approaches by analyzing data volume, change frequency, and appropriate batch sizes to select optimal loading strategies.

## Implementing Merge/Upsert Patterns

### SQL MERGE Statement Fundamentals

**Focus:** Building a solid foundation with the MERGE statement syntax

In your previous SQL work, you've used INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements separately. The MERGE statement combines these operations into a single, atomic transaction. This powerful statement lets you synchronize a target table with incoming source data.

The basic structure of a MERGE statement includes:

```sql
MERGE INTO TargetTable AS Target
USING SourceTable AS Source
ON Target.KeyColumn = Source.KeyColumn
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET Target.Column1 = Source.Column1, Target.Column2 = Source.Column2
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (Column1, Column2) VALUES (Source.Column1, Source.Column2)
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN
    DELETE;
```

Let's break down the key components:

1. **Target and Source**: The target is the table you're updating, while the source contains your new or changed data.

2. **Matching Condition**: The ON clause defines how to match records between the two tables, typically using a primary key.

3. **Action Clauses**:
   - **WHEN MATCHED**: Executes when a record exists in both source and target
   - **WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET**: Executes when a record exists in source but not in target
   - **WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE**: Executes when a record exists in target but not in source

You can also track changes made during the operation using the OUTPUT clause:

```sql
MERGE INTO Customers AS Target
USING StagingCustomers AS Source
ON Target.CustomerID = Source.CustomerID
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET Target.Name = Source.Name, Target.Email = Source.Email
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (CustomerID, Name, Email) VALUES (Source.CustomerID, Source.Name, Source.Email)
OUTPUT $action, 
       inserted.CustomerID, 
       deleted.Name AS OldName, 
       inserted.Name AS NewName;
```

This OUTPUT clause gives you a record of what changed during the merge operation, which is valuable for auditing and troubleshooting.

In job interviews, you'll often be asked to describe how you'd efficiently update a target table with new data. Explaining the MERGE statement shows you understand production-grade data operations.

### Dimension Table Merge Patterns

**Focus:** Special considerations when merging dimension data

You've already learned about dimension tables in our star schema design lesson. Now let's look at how to incrementally update them.

Dimension tables require special handling during merges because they contain business keys and descriptive attributes. Unlike fact tables, dimensions often contain the "golden record" of an entity.

When merging dimension data, you need to:

1. **Preserve dimension surrogate keys**: The primary key in your dimension should remain stable.

2. **Handle business key conflicts**: When natural keys like product codes change, you need to decide if this represents a new record or an update.

3. **Integrate with SCD patterns**: As you learned in our Slowly Changing Dimensions lesson, you may need to track history of dimension changes.

Here's an example of a dimension merge that handles these considerations:

```sql
MERGE INTO dim.Customer AS Target
USING stage.Customer AS Source
ON Target.CustomerBusinessKey = Source.CustomerBusinessKey
WHEN MATCHED AND (
    Target.Name != Source.Name OR
    Target.Email != Source.Email OR
    Target.Phone != Source.Phone
) THEN
    -- SCD Type 2: Close current record and insert new one
    UPDATE SET Target.EndDate = GETDATE(), 
               Target.IsCurrent = 0
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    -- New customer
    INSERT (CustomerBusinessKey, Name, Email, Phone, StartDate, EndDate, IsCurrent)
    VALUES (Source.CustomerBusinessKey, Source.Name, Source.Email, Source.Phone, 
            GETDATE(), NULL, 1);

-- Insert new versions of updated records
INSERT INTO dim.Customer
(CustomerBusinessKey, Name, Email, Phone, StartDate, EndDate, IsCurrent)
SELECT Source.CustomerBusinessKey, Source.Name, Source.Email, Source.Phone, 
       GETDATE(), NULL, 1
FROM stage.Customer AS Source
JOIN dim.Customer AS Target 
    ON Source.CustomerBusinessKey = Target.CustomerBusinessKey
WHERE Target.EndDate = GETDATE() -- Just updated above
AND Target.IsCurrent = 0;
```

This example implements an SCD Type 2 pattern, where we keep history of dimension changes. Notice how we:
1. First update the existing record to close it (set EndDate and IsCurrent)
2. Then insert a new record with the updated values

When interviewing for data engineering roles, employers often look for candidates who understand these dimension-specific patterns. Being able to explain why dimension merges require special handling will set you apart.

### Fact Table Merge Strategies

**Focus:** Efficient approaches for incremental fact table loads

Fact tables present unique challenges for incremental loading. They typically contain many more records than dimension tables and are connected to multiple dimensions through foreign keys.

When implementing fact table merges, consider these key strategies:

1. **Use surrogate keys from dimensions**: Fact records must reference the correct dimension surrogate keys, not business keys.

2. **Handle transaction dates carefully**: Distinguish between when an event happened (transaction date) and when it was processed (load date).

3. **Manage duplicate records**: Decide whether duplicates should be rejected, summarized, or handled as updates.

Here's an example of a fact table merge:

```sql
MERGE INTO fact.Sales AS Target
USING (
    -- Join staging data with dimensions to get surrogate keys
    SELECT 
        d.CustomerKey,
        p.ProductKey,
        t.DateKey,
        s.Quantity,
        s.Amount,
        s.TransactionDate,
        s.TransactionID
    FROM stage.Sales s
    JOIN dim.Customer d ON s.CustomerID = d.CustomerBusinessKey AND d.IsCurrent = 1
    JOIN dim.Product p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductBusinessKey AND p.IsCurrent = 1
    JOIN dim.Date t ON CAST(s.TransactionDate AS DATE) = t.DateValue
) AS Source
ON Target.TransactionID = Source.TransactionID
WHEN MATCHED AND (
    Target.Quantity != Source.Quantity OR
    Target.Amount != Source.Amount
) THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        Target.Quantity = Source.Quantity,
        Target.Amount = Source.Amount,
        Target.UpdatedDate = GETDATE()
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (CustomerKey, ProductKey, DateKey, Quantity, Amount, TransactionDate, TransactionID, LoadedDate, UpdatedDate)
    VALUES (Source.CustomerKey, Source.ProductKey, Source.DateKey, Source.Quantity, Source.Amount, 
            Source.TransactionDate, Source.TransactionID, GETDATE(), GETDATE());
```

Notice how this merge:
1. Joins the staging data with dimension tables to get the proper surrogate keys
2. Uses the TransactionID as a business key for matching
3. Updates records when business values change
4. Tracks both the original transaction date and when the record was processed

In job interviews, you might be asked to design an incremental loading process for a specific business scenario. Being able to articulate these fact table patterns shows you understand real-world data warehouse operations.

## Watermark-Based Incremental Loading

### Delta Detection Fundamentals

**Focus:** Identifying changed records efficiently

A key challenge in incremental loading is identifying which records have changed since your last load. This is where watermark-based detection comes in.

Think of a watermark as a high-water line that marks what data you've already processed. Any data "above the watermark" needs processing in your next run.

There are three main approaches to delta detection:

1. **Timestamp-based detection**: Uses a last_modified or updated_at timestamp column.

```sql
-- Step 1: Get the current watermark
DECLARE @LastWatermark DATETIME;
SELECT @LastWatermark = MAX(LastProcessedDateTime) FROM meta.Watermarks WHERE TableName = 'Customers';

-- Step 2: Identify changed records above the watermark
SELECT * FROM source.Customers 
WHERE LastModifiedDate > @LastWatermark;

-- Step 3: Update the watermark after processing
UPDATE meta.Watermarks 
SET LastProcessedDateTime = GETDATE()
WHERE TableName = 'Customers';
```

2. **Sequence-based detection**: Uses auto-increment ID or sequence numbers.

```sql
-- Step 1: Get the current watermark
DECLARE @LastProcessedID INT;
SELECT @LastProcessedID = MAX(LastProcessedID) FROM meta.Watermarks WHERE TableName = 'Orders';

-- Step 2: Identify new records above the watermark
SELECT * FROM source.Orders 
WHERE OrderID > @LastProcessedID;

-- Step 3: Update the watermark after processing
UPDATE meta.Watermarks 
SET LastProcessedID = (SELECT MAX(OrderID) FROM source.Orders)
WHERE TableName = 'Orders';
```

3. **Hash-based detection**: Uses hash values to detect any field changes.

```sql
-- Create or update a hash of all relevant columns
SELECT 
    OrderID,
    HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', CONCAT(
        CustomerID,
        OrderAmount,
        OrderStatus,
        OrderDate
    )) AS RecordHash
INTO #CurrentHashes
FROM source.Orders;

-- Compare with previously stored hashes to find changes
SELECT c.* 
FROM #CurrentHashes c
LEFT JOIN meta.OrderHashes p ON c.OrderID = p.OrderID
WHERE p.OrderID IS NULL OR p.RecordHash != c.RecordHash;

-- Update stored hashes after processing
MERGE INTO meta.OrderHashes AS Target
USING #CurrentHashes AS Source
ON Target.OrderID = Source.OrderID
WHEN MATCHED AND Target.RecordHash != Source.RecordHash THEN
    UPDATE SET Target.RecordHash = Source.RecordHash
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (OrderID, RecordHash) VALUES (Source.OrderID, Source.RecordHash);
```

Each approach has trade-offs:
- Timestamp-based is simple but requires reliable timestamps on all records
- Sequence-based is very efficient but only detects new records, not updates
- Hash-based can detect any change but requires more computation

In job interviews, you might be asked to explain how you'd identify changed records from a source system. Understanding these patterns demonstrates practical knowledge of ETL processes.

### Change Data Capture Implementation

**Focus:** Building practical CDC workflows with SQL

Change Data Capture (CDC) takes delta detection to the next level by systematically tracking changes in source systems. While SQL Server has built-in CDC features, you can also implement custom CDC approaches.

Here's how to implement a basic CDC workflow in SQL:

1. **Create change tracking metadata tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE meta.ChangeTracking (
    TableName VARCHAR(100),
    LastCaptureTime DATETIME,
    InProgress BIT,
    RecordsProcessed INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (TableName)
);
```

2. **Implement a change capture procedure:**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.CaptureCustomerChanges
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    DECLARE @LastCaptureTime DATETIME;
    DECLARE @CurrentCaptureTime DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    -- Get last capture time and mark process as in-progress
    SELECT @LastCaptureTime = LastCaptureTime 
    FROM meta.ChangeTracking 
    WHERE TableName = 'Customers';
    
    UPDATE meta.ChangeTracking
    SET InProgress = 1
    WHERE TableName = 'Customers';
    
    -- Capture changes to staging
    INSERT INTO stage.CustomerChanges (
        CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, 
        ChangeType, CapturedAt
    )
    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID, c.Name, c.Email, c.Phone,
        CASE
            WHEN h.CustomerID IS NULL THEN 'INSERT'
            ELSE 'UPDATE'
        END AS ChangeType,
        @CurrentCaptureTime
    FROM source.Customers c
    LEFT JOIN history.CustomerSnapshots h 
        ON c.CustomerID = h.CustomerID
    WHERE c.LastModified > @LastCaptureTime
    OR h.CustomerID IS NULL;
    
    -- Update change tracking metadata
    UPDATE meta.ChangeTracking
    SET LastCaptureTime = @CurrentCaptureTime,
        InProgress = 0,
        RecordsProcessed = @@ROWCOUNT
    WHERE TableName = 'Customers';
    
    -- Update history snapshot
    MERGE INTO history.CustomerSnapshots AS Target
    USING source.Customers AS Source
    ON Target.CustomerID = Source.CustomerID
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET 
            Target.Name = Source.Name,
            Target.Email = Source.Email,
            Target.Phone = Source.Phone,
            Target.LastUpdated = @CurrentCaptureTime
    WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
        INSERT (CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, LastUpdated)
        VALUES (Source.CustomerID, Source.Name, Source.Email, Source.Phone, @CurrentCaptureTime);
    
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END;
```

3. **Handle out-of-order or late-arriving changes:**

For systems where changes might arrive out of sequence, you need additional logic:

```sql
-- Additional condition to handle out-of-order changes
WHERE (c.LastModified > @LastCaptureTime OR c.LastModified > h.LastUpdated)
OR h.CustomerID IS NULL;
```

By implementing a CDC workflow, you create a reliable system for capturing changes that:
- Tracks when changes were processed
- Handles potential failures with transaction management
- Maintains historical snapshots for comparison

Employers value candidates who understand CDC because it forms the backbone of reliable data integration. During interviews, explain how CDC helps maintain data consistency across systems.

### Historical State Management

**Focus:** Maintaining data lineage during incremental loads

As you incrementally load data, you need to track where records came from and when they were processed. This data lineage is crucial for auditing, troubleshooting, and compliance.

Here are key patterns for managing historical states:

1. **Add tracking columns to your tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE fact.Sales (
    SalesKey INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    -- Business columns
    CustomerKey INT NOT NULL,
    ProductKey INT NOT NULL,
    DateKey INT NOT NULL,
    Amount DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Data lineage columns
    SourceSystem VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    SourceBatchID VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LoadedDateTime DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    UpdatedDateTime DATETIME NULL,
    CurrentRecord BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);
```

2. **Maintain history tables for full audit trails:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE history.SalesHistory (
    HistoryID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    SalesKey INT NOT NULL,
    -- Business columns (same as fact table)
    CustomerKey INT NOT NULL,
    ProductKey INT NOT NULL,
    DateKey INT NOT NULL,
    Amount DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Data lineage columns
    SourceSystem VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    SourceBatchID VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    EffectiveFrom DATETIME NOT NULL,
    EffectiveTo DATETIME NULL,
    ChangeType VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
);
```

3. **Handle late-arriving data correctly:**

Late-arriving data has a transaction date in the past but arrives after records with more recent dates.

```sql
-- First, identify if we have any existing records for this transaction
DECLARE @ExistingRecord BIT = 0;
SELECT @ExistingRecord = 1 
FROM fact.Sales 
WHERE TransactionID = @TransactionID;

-- For late-arriving data, decide how to handle based on business rules
IF @ExistingRecord = 1 AND @TransactionDate < (
    SELECT TransactionDate 
    FROM fact.Sales 
    WHERE TransactionID = @TransactionID
)
BEGIN
    -- Option 1: Reject the older data
    RAISERROR('Rejected older version of existing transaction', 16, 1);
    
    -- Option 2: Update if the data is more accurate
    UPDATE fact.Sales
    SET Amount = @NewAmount,
        Quantity = @NewQuantity,
        UpdatedDateTime = GETDATE(),
        SourceBatchID = @CurrentBatchID
    WHERE TransactionID = @TransactionID
    AND -- Some condition indicating this data is more accurate
END
```

Proper historical state management enables you to:
- Trace any record back to its source
- Understand when and how data changed
- Recover from errors by replaying history
- Comply with regulations requiring data lineage

When interviewing for data engineering roles, highlight your understanding of data lineage. Companies in regulated industries like healthcare or finance particularly value this knowledge.

## Performance Tradeoff Evaluation

### Full Refresh vs. Incremental Analysis

**Focus:** Decision frameworks for loading strategy selection

When designing a data loading strategy, you need to choose between full refresh and incremental approaches. This decision impacts processing time, resource usage, and data consistency.

Here's a framework to help you decide:

1. **Data Volume Considerations:**

| Data Size | Change % | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Small (<100K rows) | Any | Full refresh is simpler and often fast enough |
| Medium (100K-10M rows) | <10% | Incremental loading provides significant benefits |
| Large (>10M rows) | <5% | Incremental loading is almost always required |
| Any size | >50% | Consider full refresh as incremental complexity may not be worth it |

2. **Source System Impact:**

Consider how your extraction affects source systems:
- Can the source system handle full table scans?
- Is the source system performance-sensitive during business hours?
- Does the source system have change tracking capabilities?

```sql
-- Example: Check if a source system supports change tracking
IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys.change_tracking_databases 
    WHERE database_id = DB_ID('SourceDB')
)
BEGIN
    -- Use change tracking approach
    EXEC etl.IncrementalLoad_WithChangeTracking;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    -- Fall back to timestamp-based approach or full refresh
    EXEC etl.IncrementalLoad_WithTimestamps;
END
```

3. **Recovery and Restart Capabilities:**

Full refresh is simpler to restart after failures:

```sql
-- Full refresh restart is simple
TRUNCATE TABLE target.Customers;
INSERT INTO target.Customers
SELECT * FROM source.Customers;
```

Incremental loads need checkpoint management:

```sql
-- Incremental load needs checkpoint tracking
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM meta.LoadStatus WHERE TableName = 'Customers' AND Status = 'Failed')
BEGIN
    -- Rollback to last successful watermark
    UPDATE meta.Watermarks
    SET CurrentWatermark = LastSuccessfulWatermark
    WHERE TableName = 'Customers';
    
    -- Clear partial data
    DELETE FROM target.Customers
    WHERE LoadBatchID = (SELECT LastFailedBatchID FROM meta.LoadStatus WHERE TableName = 'Customers');
END
```

In job interviews, you might be asked to design a loading strategy for a specific scenario. Being able to articulate these decision factors shows you understand real-world engineering trade-offs.

### Batch Size Optimization

**Focus:** Finding the sweet spot for incremental processing

When implementing incremental loads, batch size significantly impacts performance. Too large, and you risk memory issues; too small, and overhead dominates.

Here are key considerations for optimizing batch size:

1. **Memory Management:**

Large batches consume more memory. Monitor memory usage during processing:

```sql
-- Dynamic batch size based on table size
DECLARE @EstimatedRowSize INT = 1024; -- Average bytes per row
DECLARE @AvailableMemoryMB INT = 1000; -- Memory budget in MB
DECLARE @MaxBatchSize INT;

SET @MaxBatchSize = (@AvailableMemoryMB * 1024 * 1024) / @EstimatedRowSize;

-- Use batch size in your processing
WHILE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM stage.PendingRecords)
BEGIN
    -- Process next batch
    INSERT INTO target.Table
    SELECT TOP (@MaxBatchSize) * 
    FROM stage.PendingRecords
    ORDER BY RecordID;
    
    -- Remove processed records
    DELETE p
    FROM stage.PendingRecords p
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT TOP (@MaxBatchSize) RecordID 
        FROM stage.PendingRecords
        ORDER BY RecordID
    ) b ON p.RecordID = b.RecordID;
END
```

2. **Transaction Lock Duration:**

Larger batches hold locks longer, potentially blocking other processes:

```sql
-- Use smaller transactions to reduce lock contention
DECLARE @BatchSize INT = 10000;
DECLARE @CurrentID INT = 0;
DECLARE @MaxID INT;

SELECT @MaxID = MAX(ID) FROM stage.PendingRecords;

WHILE @CurrentID < @MaxID
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    -- Process next batch
    INSERT INTO target.Table
    SELECT * FROM stage.PendingRecords
    WHERE ID > @CurrentID AND ID <= @CurrentID + @BatchSize;
    
    SET @CurrentID = @CurrentID + @BatchSize;
    
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    
    -- Optional: Add a short delay to reduce resource contention
    WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:00.1';
END
```

3. **Benchmarking Different Batch Sizes:**

You should test different batch sizes to find the optimal value:

```sql
-- Example benchmarking procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.BenchmarkBatchSizes
AS
BEGIN
    CREATE TABLE #Results (
        BatchSize INT,
        ExecutionTimeMS INT
    );
    
    -- Test different batch sizes
    DECLARE @BatchSizes TABLE (Size INT);
    INSERT INTO @BatchSizes VALUES (1000), (5000), (10000), (50000), (100000);
    
    DECLARE @Size INT;
    DECLARE @StartTime DATETIME;
    DECLARE @EndTime DATETIME;
    
    DECLARE BatchSizeCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT Size FROM @BatchSizes;
    OPEN BatchSizeCursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM BatchSizeCursor INTO @Size;
    
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        -- Reset test environment
        TRUNCATE TABLE target.TestTable;
        
        SET @StartTime = GETDATE();
        
        -- Run test with current batch size
        EXEC etl.ProcessIncrementalLoad @BatchSize = @Size;
        
        SET @EndTime = GETDATE();
        
        -- Record results
        INSERT INTO #Results (BatchSize, ExecutionTimeMS)
        VALUES (@Size, DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTime, @EndTime));
        
        FETCH NEXT FROM BatchSizeCursor INTO @Size;
    END
    
    CLOSE BatchSizeCursor;
    DEALLOCATE BatchSizeCursor;
    
    -- Show results
    SELECT * FROM #Results ORDER BY ExecutionTimeMS;
END
```

The optimal batch size varies by:
- Available server memory
- Database concurrency needs
- Network latency and throughput
- Data complexity

In job interviews, explaining how you approach batch size optimization shows you understand the practical aspects of data pipeline performance tuning.

### Strategy Selection for Real-World Scenarios

**Focus:** Applying decision criteria to business cases

Different data scenarios require different incremental loading approaches. Let's explore how to select the right strategy for common real-world cases.

1. **High-Velocity OLTP Sources:**

For systems with constant high-volume changes like e-commerce platforms:

```sql
-- Approach: High-frequency micro-batches with timestamp watermarks
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.ProcessHighVelocitySource
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @WatermarkTable VARCHAR(100) = 'Orders';
    DECLARE @LastWatermark DATETIME;
    DECLARE @CurrentWatermark DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    -- Get current watermark with a slight buffer to avoid missing records
    -- (5 seconds buffer in this example)
    SET @CurrentWatermark = DATEADD(SECOND, -5, @CurrentWatermark);
    
    -- Get last processed watermark
    SELECT @LastWatermark = LastProcessedTime
    FROM meta.Watermarks
    WHERE TableName = @WatermarkTable;
    
    -- Process only the delta
    INSERT INTO stage.Orders
    SELECT * FROM source.Orders
    WHERE LastModified > @LastWatermark
    AND LastModified <= @CurrentWatermark;
    
    -- Only update watermark if processing succeeded
    IF @@ROWCOUNT > 0
    BEGIN
        UPDATE meta.Watermarks
        SET LastProcessedTime = @CurrentWatermark
        WHERE TableName = @WatermarkTable;
    END
END
```

Key considerations:
- Use micro-batches (frequent small loads)
- Include a buffer time to avoid missing records
- Implement robust error handling

2. **Slowly Changing Reference Data:**

For reference data that changes infrequently, like product catalogs:

```sql
-- Approach: Hash-based detection with daily frequency
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.ProcessReferenceData
AS
BEGIN
    -- Create temp table with current hash values
    SELECT 
        ProductID,
        HASHBYTES('SHA2_256', CONCAT(
            ProductName,
            Category,
            Price,
            ISNULL(Description, '')
        )) AS RecordHash
    INTO #CurrentHashes
    FROM source.Products;
    
    -- Find changes by comparing with stored hashes
    INSERT INTO stage.ProductChanges
    SELECT 
        s.ProductID, 
        s.ProductName,
        s.Category,
        s.Price,
        s.Description,
        CASE
            WHEN h.ProductID IS NULL THEN 'INSERT'
            ELSE 'UPDATE'
        END AS ChangeType
    FROM source.Products s
    LEFT JOIN #CurrentHashes c ON s.ProductID = c.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN meta.ProductHashes h ON s.ProductID = h.ProductID
    WHERE h.ProductID IS NULL OR h.RecordHash != c.RecordHash;
    
    -- Update stored hashes
    MERGE INTO meta.ProductHashes AS Target
    USING #CurrentHashes AS Source
    ON Target.ProductID = Source.ProductID
    WHEN MATCHED AND Target.RecordHash != Source.RecordHash THEN
        UPDATE SET Target.RecordHash = Source.RecordHash
    WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
        INSERT (ProductID, RecordHash) VALUES (Source.ProductID, Source.RecordHash);
END
```

Key considerations:
- Use hash-based detection for comprehensive change tracking
- Run less frequently (daily or weekly)
- Focus on data quality over speed

3. **Mixed Strategy Implementation:**

For complex data warehouses with varied sources:

```sql
-- Approach: Orchestrated pipeline with source-specific strategies
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.OrchestrateDailyLoad
AS
BEGIN
    -- 1. Process high-frequency transaction data
    EXEC etl.ProcessHighVelocitySource;
    
    -- 2. Process medium-change customer data
    EXEC etl.ProcessCustomerDelta;
    
    -- 3. Process slow-changing reference data
    IF DATEPART(WEEKDAY, GETDATE()) = 1 -- Only on Mondays
    BEGIN
        EXEC etl.ProcessReferenceData;
    END
    
    -- 4. Process aggregates after all base data is loaded
    EXEC etl.RebuildAggregates;
END
```

Key considerations:
- Orchestrate dependencies between data loads
- Use different frequencies for different data types
- Apply appropriate techniques based on change frequency

In job interviews, you might need to design an incremental loading strategy for a complex data warehouse. Being able to mix and match these approaches shows you can handle real-world complexity.

## Hands-On Practice

Let's apply what we've learned with a practical exercise building an incremental loading pipeline for a dimensional model.

### Exercise: Implement an Incremental Loading Pipeline

**Scenario:** You're building a sales data warehouse with:
- A customer dimension with simple SCD Type 2 handling
- A transaction fact table loaded incrementally based on date watermarks

#### Step 1: Create the metadata tables for tracking incremental loads

```sql
-- Create watermark tracking table
CREATE TABLE meta.Watermarks (
    TableName VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    LastProcessedDateTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    LastSuccessfulDateTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    UpdatedBy VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    UpdatedAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Initialize watermarks
INSERT INTO meta.Watermarks (TableName, LastProcessedDateTime, LastSuccessfulDateTime, UpdatedBy)
VALUES 
('dim.Customer', '2000-01-01', '2000-01-01', 'SYSTEM'),
('fact.Transaction', '2000-01-01', '2000-01-01', 'SYSTEM');
```

#### Step 2: Implement the customer dimension merge with SCD Type 2

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.LoadCustomerDimension
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    DECLARE @LastProcessedTime DATETIME;
    DECLARE @CurrentProcessTime DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    -- Get the last processed timestamp
    SELECT @LastProcessedTime = LastProcessedDateTime
    FROM meta.Watermarks
    WHERE TableName = 'dim.Customer';
    
    -- Find changed customers
    WITH ChangedCustomers AS (
        SELECT 
            s.CustomerID,
            s.Name,
            s.Email,
            s.Phone,
            s.Address,
            d.CustomerKey,
            d.IsCurrent
        FROM stage.Customers s
        LEFT JOIN dim.Customer d ON 
            s.CustomerID = d.CustomerID AND 
            d.IsCurrent = 1
        WHERE s.LastModified > @LastProcessedTime
        AND (
            d.CustomerKey IS NULL OR -- New customer
            d.Name != s.Name OR      -- Changed attributes
            d.Email != s.Email OR
            d.Phone != s.Phone OR
            d.Address != s.Address
        )
    )
    
    -- Close current records for changed customers
    UPDATE d
    SET 
        d.EndDate = @CurrentProcessTime,
        d.IsCurrent = 0
    FROM dim.Customer d
    JOIN ChangedCustomers c ON 
        d.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey AND
        d.IsCurrent = 1;
    
    -- Insert new versions
    INSERT INTO dim.Customer (
        CustomerID, 
        Name, 
        Email, 
        Phone, 
        Address,
        StartDate,
        EndDate,
        IsCurrent
    )
    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID,
        c.Name,
        c.Email,
        c.Phone,
        c.Address,
        @CurrentProcessTime,
        NULL,
        1
    FROM ChangedCustomers c;
    
    -- Update the watermark
    UPDATE meta.Watermarks
    SET 
        LastProcessedDateTime = @CurrentProcessTime,
        LastSuccessfulDateTime = @CurrentProcessTime,
        UpdatedBy = SYSTEM_USER,
        UpdatedAt = GETDATE()
    WHERE TableName = 'dim.Customer';
    
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END;
```

#### Step 3: Implement the transaction fact table incremental load

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.LoadTransactionFact
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    DECLARE @LastProcessedTime DATETIME;
    DECLARE @CurrentProcessTime DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    -- Get the last processed timestamp
    SELECT @LastProcessedTime = LastProcessedDateTime
    FROM meta.Watermarks
    WHERE TableName = 'fact.Transaction';
    
    -- Load new transactions
    INSERT INTO fact.Transaction (
        TransactionID,
        CustomerKey,
        ProductKey,
        DateKey,
        Amount,
        Quantity,
        TransactionDate,
        LoadedDate
    )
    SELECT 
        s.TransactionID,
        c.CustomerKey,
        p.ProductKey,
        d.DateKey,
        s.Amount,
        s.Quantity,
        s.TransactionDate,
        @CurrentProcessTime
    FROM stage.Transactions s
    JOIN dim.Customer c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID AND c.IsCurrent = 1
    JOIN dim.Product p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID AND p.IsCurrent = 1
    JOIN dim.Date d ON CAST(s.TransactionDate AS DATE) = d.DateValue
    LEFT JOIN fact.Transaction f ON s.TransactionID = f.TransactionID
    WHERE s.LastModified > @LastProcessedTime
    AND f.TransactionID IS NULL; -- Only load new transactions
    
    -- Update the watermark
    UPDATE meta.Watermarks
    SET 
        LastProcessedDateTime = @CurrentProcessTime,
        LastSuccessfulDateTime = @CurrentProcessTime,
        UpdatedBy = SYSTEM_USER,
        UpdatedAt = GETDATE()
    WHERE TableName = 'fact.Transaction';
    
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END;
```

#### Step 4: Create an orchestration procedure

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE etl.RunIncrementalLoad
AS
BEGIN
    -- Always load dimensions before facts
    EXEC etl.LoadCustomerDimension;
    EXEC etl.LoadProductDimension;
    EXEC etl.LoadDateDimension;
    
    -- Then load facts
    EXEC etl.LoadTransactionFact;
    
    -- Finally, refresh any dependent views or aggregates
    EXEC etl.RefreshSalesSummaries;
END;
```

#### Step 5: Compare performance between full refresh and incremental

Create a test script that:
1. Loads a full dataset using complete refresh
2. Loads the same dataset using incremental loading
3. Compares execution time and resource usage

```sql
-- Test script to compare approaches
CREATE PROCEDURE test.CompareLoadingStrategies
AS
BEGIN
    -- Clear test environment
    EXEC test.ResetTestEnvironment;
    
    -- Test 1: Full refresh
    DECLARE @FullRefreshStart DATETIME = GETDATE();
    EXEC etl.FullRefreshLoad;
    DECLARE @FullRefreshEnd DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    -- Record metrics
    INSERT INTO test.PerformanceResults (TestName, ExecutionTimeMS, RecordsProcessed)
    VALUES (
        'Full Refresh', 
        DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @FullRefreshStart, @FullRefreshEnd),
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact.Transaction)
    );
    
    -- Reset test environment
    EXEC test.ResetTestEnvironment;
    
    -- Test 2: Incremental load
    DECLARE @IncrementalStart DATETIME = GETDATE();
    EXEC etl.RunIncrementalLoad;
    DECLARE @IncrementalEnd DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    -- Record metrics
    INSERT INTO test.PerformanceResults (TestName, ExecutionTimeMS, RecordsProcessed)
    VALUES (
        'Incremental Load', 
        DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @IncrementalStart, @IncrementalEnd),
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact.Transaction)
    );
    
    -- Display results
    SELECT * FROM test.PerformanceResults;
END;
```

Working through this exercise helps you apply the key concepts of incremental loading in a practical setting. This hands-on experience will be valuable when describing your data engineering skills in job interviews.

# Glossary

## Core Incremental Loading Concepts

**Incremental Loading** A data integration approach that processes only new or changed records since the last load, rather than reprocessing all data. This method significantly reduces processing time, system resources, and database load for large datasets.

**Full Refresh** The opposite of incremental loading - completely replacing target data with a fresh copy from the source. While simpler to implement, full refresh becomes impractical as data volumes grow.

**Delta Processing** Another term for incremental loading, referring to processing only the "delta" or difference between current and previously processed data.

**Watermark** A timestamp, sequence number, or other identifier that marks the boundary between data that has been processed and data that still needs processing. Acts as a "high-water mark" for incremental loads.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** A systematic approach to identify and capture changes made to data in a database. CDC can be implemented using database features or custom logic to track insertions, updates, and deletions.

**Data Lineage** The ability to trace data from its source through transformation steps to its final destination, including when and how it was processed. Essential for auditing and troubleshooting incremental loading processes.

## SQL MERGE Operations

**MERGE Statement** A SQL statement that combines INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations into a single atomic transaction. Allows synchronization of target tables with source data in one operation.

**Upsert** A portmanteau of "update" and "insert" - an operation that updates a record if it exists, or inserts it if it doesn't. The MERGE statement is SQL Server's primary upsert mechanism.

**WHEN MATCHED** A clause in a MERGE statement that defines actions to take when a record exists in both source and target tables. Typically used for UPDATE operations.

**WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET** A clause in a MERGE statement that defines actions for records that exist in the source but not in the target. Typically used for INSERT operations.

**WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE** A clause in a MERGE statement that defines actions for records that exist in the target but not in the source. Often used for DELETE operations or marking records as inactive.

**OUTPUT Clause** A feature of MERGE statements that returns information about the rows affected by the operation. Useful for auditing changes and capturing merge statistics.

**USING Clause** The part of a MERGE statement that specifies the source data, which can be a table, view, or derived table from a subquery.

## Watermark Strategies

**Timestamp-Based Watermark** Uses date/time columns (like LastModified, UpdatedDate) to identify records that have changed since the last processing run. Simple to implement but requires reliable timestamps.

**Sequence-Based Watermark** Uses auto-incrementing IDs or sequence numbers to identify new records. Very efficient but typically only detects new records, not updates to existing ones.

**Hash-Based Detection** Uses hash values calculated from record content to detect any changes in data. Can identify updates to any field but requires more computation than other methods.

**Monotonic Watermark** A watermark value that always increases over time, ensuring that subsequent incremental loads don't miss or duplicate data.

**High-Water Mark** The highest watermark value successfully processed. Used as the starting point for the next incremental load to ensure no data is missed.

**Watermark Reset** The process of setting a watermark back to an earlier value, typically done when reprocessing data or recovering from errors.

## Change Detection Patterns

**Change Tracking** The systematic monitoring and recording of changes to database records. Can be implemented using database built-in features or custom applications.

**Delta Detection** The process of identifying which records have changed since the last processing cycle. Foundation of all incremental loading strategies.

**Late-Arriving Data** Records that have a transaction date in the past but arrive after records with more recent dates. Common in distributed systems and requires special handling.

**Out-of-Order Processing** Handling data that arrives in a different sequence than it was created. Requires careful watermark management to ensure data consistency.

**Change Log** A record of all changes made to data, typically including what changed, when it changed, and who made the change. Used for both auditing and change detection.

**Tombstone Records** Special records that indicate a deletion has occurred, used when the original record is no longer available in the source system.

## Data Consistency and State Management

**Historical State** Maintaining a record of how data appeared at different points in time. Essential for time-series analysis and regulatory compliance.

**Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)** A dimensional modeling technique for handling changes to dimension data over time. Different SCD types (1, 2, 3) offer different trade-offs between history preservation and complexity.

**Effective Dating** Using start and end dates to track when a particular version of a record was valid. Commonly used in SCD Type 2 implementations.

**Current Flag** A boolean indicator showing which version of a record is currently active. Used in SCD Type 2 to quickly identify current records without date comparisons.

**Surrogate Key** An artificial primary key (often an auto-incrementing number) used in data warehouses instead of natural business keys. Remains stable even when business attributes change.

**Natural Key** The business identifier for a record (like customer ID, product code). May change over time, which is why surrogate keys are preferred in data warehouses.

**Data Integrity** Ensuring that data remains accurate and consistent throughout incremental loading processes, particularly when handling updates and deletes.

## Performance and Optimization

**Batch Size** The number of records processed in a single operation. Optimal batch size balances memory usage, transaction lock duration, and processing efficiency.

**Micro-Batch Processing** Processing data in very small, frequent batches (often measured in seconds or minutes) to provide near real-time data updates.

**Bulk Operations** Database operations optimized for processing large volumes of data efficiently, such as BULK INSERT or batch MERGE operations.

**Transaction Scope** The boundary that defines which operations are grouped together as a single unit of work. Important for maintaining consistency in incremental loads.

**Lock Duration** The amount of time database locks are held during processing. Larger batches hold locks longer, potentially blocking other operations.

**Resource Contention** Competition between different processes for the same database resources (CPU, memory, I/O). Proper batch sizing helps minimize contention.

**Checkpoint Management** Saving processing state at regular intervals to enable restart from a known good point if processing fails partway through.

## Error Handling and Recovery

**Idempotent Operation** A process that produces the same result regardless of how many times it's executed. Critical for reliable incremental loading that can be safely rerun.

**Restart and Recovery** The ability to resume incremental loading from a failure point rather than starting over. Typically implemented through checkpoints and watermark management.

**Rollback Strategy** A plan for undoing changes when errors occur during incremental loading. May involve transaction rollback or point-in-time recovery.

**Error Quarantine** Isolating problematic records that fail validation or processing, allowing the rest of the incremental load to proceed successfully.

**Dead Letter Queue** A storage location for records that repeatedly fail processing, allowing manual review and correction without blocking automated processing.

**Circuit Breaker Pattern** A design pattern that temporarily halts processing when error rates exceed acceptable thresholds, preventing cascade failures.

## Data Quality and Validation

**Data Validation** Checking incremental data against business rules and quality standards before loading into target systems. May include format validation, referential integrity checks, and business rule validation.

**Data Profiling** Analyzing incremental data to understand its structure, quality, and characteristics. Helps identify data quality issues before they impact downstream systems.

**Referential Integrity** Ensuring that relationships between tables remain valid during incremental loading. Foreign key constraints and lookup validations help maintain integrity.

**Data Reconciliation** Comparing incremental load results with source data or expected outcomes to verify processing accuracy.

**Quality Metrics** Quantitative measures of data quality including completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness. Used to monitor incremental loading success.

**Exception Handling** The systematic handling of data that doesn't meet validation criteria during incremental loads, including logging rejected records and applying business rules for handling anomalies.

## Business Integration Concepts

**Business Key** The natural identifier used by business users to identify records (like customer number, order ID). May change over time, requiring careful handling in incremental loads.

**Source System of Record** The authoritative source for specific data elements. Important for determining precedence when the same data exists in multiple sources.

**Data Currency** How current or up-to-date data is after incremental loading. Different business processes have different currency requirements.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)** Formal agreements defining expected performance for incremental loading processes, including maximum processing time and data freshness requirements.

**Business Rule Engine** Logic that applies business-specific transformations and validations during incremental loading. May be implemented in stored procedures or external applications.

**Master Data Management (MDM)** The practice of managing critical business entities consistently across systems. Incremental loading must respect MDM policies and hierarchies.

## Technical Implementation Terms

**Staging Area** Temporary storage location where incremental data is held during processing. Allows for validation and transformation before loading into final destinations.

**Control Table** A database table that stores metadata about incremental loading processes, such as watermarks, batch status, and processing parameters.

**Job Orchestration** Coordinating multiple incremental loading processes to execute in the correct order with proper dependency management.

**Parallel Processing** Executing multiple incremental loading operations simultaneously to reduce overall processing time. Requires careful coordination to avoid conflicts.

**Connection Pooling** Managing database connections efficiently during incremental loading to balance performance with resource usage.

**Load Distribution** Spreading incremental loading work across multiple processes or servers to improve performance and reliability.

**Configuration Management** Storing and managing parameters for incremental loading processes in a centralized, maintainable way rather than hard-coding values.

## Monitoring and Observability

**Load Metrics** Quantitative measures of incremental loading performance including records processed, execution time, and resource utilization.

**Processing Latency** The time between when data becomes available in source systems and when it's loaded into target systems through incremental processing.

**Success Rate** The percentage of incremental loading attempts that complete successfully without errors or data quality issues.

**Data Freshness** A measure of how recent the data is in target systems relative to when it was created or updated in source systems.

**Throughput** The rate at which incremental loading processes can handle data, typically measured in records per second or transactions per minute.

**Alerting Threshold** Predefined values that trigger notifications when incremental loading metrics exceed acceptable ranges, enabling proactive problem resolution.

**Audit Trail** A complete record of all incremental loading activities including what data was processed, when, and by which process. Essential for compliance and troubleshooting.

# Incremental Loading with SQL - Progressive Exercises

## Exercise 1: Basic MERGE Operations (Beginner)

**Learning Objective:** Master the fundamentals of SQL MERGE statements for simple upsert operations, building on your existing INSERT/UPDATE knowledge from Week 1.

### Scenario
You're working for an online bookstore that receives daily customer updates from their registration system. New customers need to be inserted, existing customers need their information updated, and you need to track when each record was last processed.

### Sample Data Setup
```sql
-- Create the target customer table (your data warehouse)
CREATE TABLE dw.Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    State VARCHAR(2),
    LastUpdated DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    CreatedDate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Create the daily updates staging table
CREATE TABLE staging.CustomerUpdates (
    CustomerID INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    State VARCHAR(2),
    UpdateDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Insert sample existing customers
INSERT INTO dw.Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, City, State, CreatedDate)
VALUES 
(1, 'John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@email.com', '555-0101', 'New York', 'NY', '2024-01-01'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'jane.doe@email.com', '555-0102', 'Los Angeles', 'CA', '2024-01-01');

-- Insert sample daily updates (includes one new customer and one update)
INSERT INTO staging.CustomerUpdates (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, City, State)
VALUES 
(1, 'John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@newemail.com', '555-0101', 'Boston', 'MA'), -- Updated customer
(3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob.johnson@email.com', '555-0103', 'Chicago', 'IL'); -- New customer
```

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Create Your First MERGE Statement**
Write a MERGE statement that:
- Updates existing customers when their information changes
- Inserts new customers when they don't exist
- Updates the LastUpdated timestamp for all processed records
- Uses the OUTPUT clause to show what actions were taken

**Task 2: Add Conditional Updates**
Modify your MERGE to only update records when the data has actually changed (not just update every matched record). This is more efficient and preserves original timestamps for unchanged data.

**Task 3: Handle Missing Data**
Enhance your MERGE to handle cases where some fields in the staging data might be NULL, preserving existing values instead of overwriting with NULLs.

### Expected Outcomes
- Customer 1 should be updated with new email and city
- Customer 3 should be inserted as a new record
- Customer 2 should remain unchanged
- OUTPUT clause should show 1 UPDATE and 1 INSERT action

### Success Criteria
- MERGE completes without errors
- Only records with actual changes are updated
- New records are properly inserted
- Timestamps accurately reflect processing time
- No data is lost or corrupted

---

## Exercise 2: Watermark-Based Incremental Loading (Beginner-Intermediate)

**Learning Objective:** Implement timestamp-based watermarks to process only changed data, understanding how to track processing progress reliably.

### Scenario
Your bookstore's sales system generates thousands of orders daily. Instead of reprocessing all historical orders every time, you need to implement incremental loading that only processes orders created or modified since your last load.

### Additional Sample Data Setup
```sql
-- Create the orders fact table
CREATE TABLE dw.Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT NOT NULL,
    OrderDate DATE NOT NULL,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    Status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    LoadedDate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    UpdatedDate DATETIME NULL
);

-- Create the source orders table (simulating the transactional system)
CREATE TABLE source.Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT NOT NULL,
    OrderDate DATE NOT NULL,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    Status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    CreatedDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
    LastModified DATETIME NOT NULL
);

-- Create watermark tracking table
CREATE TABLE meta.LoadWatermarks (
    TableName VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    LastProcessedDateTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    ProcessedBy VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ProcessedAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Initialize the watermark
INSERT INTO meta.LoadWatermarks (TableName, LastProcessedDateTime, ProcessedBy)
VALUES ('Orders', '2024-01-01 00:00:00', 'SYSTEM');

-- Insert sample source data spanning several days
INSERT INTO source.Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, Status, CreatedDate, LastModified)
VALUES 
(1001, 1, '2024-01-15', 45.99, 'Shipped', '2024-01-15 09:30:00', '2024-01-15 09:30:00'),
(1002, 2, '2024-01-15', 23.50, 'Processing', '2024-01-15 14:20:00', '2024-01-16 10:15:00'), -- Modified next day
(1003, 1, '2024-01-16', 67.25, 'Shipped', '2024-01-16 11:45:00', '2024-01-16 11:45:00'),
(1004, 3, '2024-01-17', 34.75, 'Processing', '2024-01-17 16:22:00', '2024-01-17 16:22:00');
```

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Create a Basic Watermark-Based Load Process**
Write a stored procedure that:
- Retrieves the current watermark for the Orders table
- Processes only orders modified since the last watermark
- Uses MERGE to handle both new and updated orders
- Updates the watermark after successful processing

**Task 2: Add Error Handling and Rollback**
Enhance your procedure with:
- TRY-CATCH error handling
- Transaction management that rolls back changes if errors occur
- Watermark updates only on successful completion
- Logging of processing results

**Task 3: Handle Concurrent Processing**
Modify your solution to prevent multiple processes from running simultaneously:
- Add a "processing in progress" flag to the watermark table
- Check and set this flag before starting processing
- Clear the flag when processing completes
- Handle cases where the previous process failed and left the flag set

### Expected Outcomes
- First run processes all 4 orders (initial load)
- Second run processes only orders modified after the first run
- Watermark advances with each successful run
- Failed runs don't advance the watermark

### Advanced Challenge
- Implement a "safety buffer" that processes records slightly before the watermark to handle clock differences between systems
- Add logging that tracks how many records were processed in each run

---

## Exercise 3: Change Data Capture with Error Handling (Intermediate)

**Learning Objective:** Build a robust CDC system that can handle various error conditions and data quality issues while maintaining data consistency.

### Scenario
Your bookstore is expanding and now receives product updates from multiple suppliers. Each supplier has different data quality standards, and updates can arrive out of order. You need a CDC system that can handle these challenges gracefully.

### Complex Sample Data Setup
```sql
-- Create product dimension table
CREATE TABLE dw.Products (
    ProductKey INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    CategoryID INT NOT NULL,
    Price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    SupplierID INT NOT NULL,
    IsActive BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    CreatedDate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    UpdatedDate DATETIME NULL,
    SourceSystem VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (ProductID, SourceSystem)
);

-- Create source product updates table
CREATE TABLE source.ProductUpdates (
    UpdateID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID VARCHAR(20),
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    CategoryID INT,
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    SupplierID INT,
    IsActive BIT,
    UpdateType VARCHAR(10), -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    SourceSystem VARCHAR(50),
    UpdateTimestamp DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    ProcessedFlag BIT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Create error logging table
CREATE TABLE logs.ProcessingErrors (
    ErrorID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    TableName VARCHAR(100),
    RecordID VARCHAR(50),
    ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(1000),
    ErrorSeverity INT,
    ErrorTimestamp DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    ProcessedFlag BIT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Create processing statistics table
CREATE TABLE meta.ProcessingStats (
    ProcessingID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    TableName VARCHAR(100),
    ProcessingDate DATETIME,
    RecordsProcessed INT,
    RecordsInserted INT,
    RecordsUpdated INT,
    RecordsDeleted INT,
    ErrorsEncountered INT,
    ProcessingTimeSeconds INT
);

-- Insert sample data with various quality issues
INSERT INTO source.ProductUpdates (ProductID, ProductName, CategoryID, Price, SupplierID, IsActive, UpdateType, SourceSystem)
VALUES 
-- Good data
('BOOK001', 'The Great Gatsby', 1, 12.99, 101, 1, 'INSERT', 'SupplierA'),
('BOOK002', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 1, 14.99, 101, 1, 'INSERT', 'SupplierA'),
-- Data quality issues

        CAST(((@Counter % 50) + 10) AS DECIMAL(10,2)), -- Unit price 10-60
        CAST(((@Counter % 5) + 1) * ((@Counter % 50) + 10) AS DECIMAL(10,2)), -- Total amount
        @BatchID
    );
    
    SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;
    
    -- Insert in smaller chunks to avoid memory issues
    IF @Counter % 10000 = 0
