# CTEs and Query Performance Exercise Solutions

## Exercise 1 Solution: Basic CTE vs Subquery Comparison

### Complete Solution
```sql
-- Task 1: Subquery approach
SELECT 
    c.CustomerName,
    c.City,
    c.Region,
    customer_totals.TotalSpent
FROM Customers c
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING SUM(OrderTotal) > 5000
) customer_totals ON c.CustomerID = customer_totals.CustomerID
ORDER BY customer_totals.TotalSpent DESC;

-- Task 2: CTE approach (cleaner and more readable)
WITH HighValueCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING SUM(OrderTotal) > 5000
)
SELECT 
    c.CustomerName,
    c.City,  
    c.Region,
    hvc.TotalSpent
FROM HighValueCustomers hvc
JOIN Customers c ON hvc.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
ORDER BY hvc.TotalSpent DESC;

-- Task 3: Regional summary using CTE approach
WITH HighValueCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING SUM(OrderTotal) > 5000
),
CustomerRegionalAnalysis AS (
    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID,
        c.CustomerName,
        c.City,
        c.Region,
        hvc.TotalSpent
    FROM HighValueCustomers hvc
    JOIN Customers c ON hvc.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
)
SELECT 
    Region,
    COUNT(*) AS HighValueCustomerCount,
    AVG(TotalSpent) AS AvgCustomerValue,
    SUM(TotalSpent) AS RegionalTotal
FROM CustomerRegionalAnalysis
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY RegionalTotal DESC;

-- Debugging example: Run just the CTE portion
WITH HighValueCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent,
        COUNT(*) AS OrderCount,
        AVG(OrderTotal) AS AvgOrderValue
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING SUM(OrderTotal) > 5000
)
-- Debug by running just this part first
SELECT * FROM HighValueCustomers
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
```

### Expected Results
```
CustomerName     | City         | Region     | TotalSpent
-----------------|--------------|------------|------------
Enterprise Ltd   | Boston       | Northeast  | 6100.00
Global Industries| Los Angeles  | West       | 6000.00
Acme Corp       | New York     | Northeast  | 5200.00

Regional Summary:
Region    | HighValueCustomerCount | AvgCustomerValue | RegionalTotal
----------|----------------------|------------------|---------------
Northeast | 2                    | 5650.00          | 11300.00
West      | 1                    | 6000.00          | 6000.00
```

### Key Learning Points
1. **Readability**: CTE version is immediately understandable - "HighValueCustomers" explains the business concept
2. **Debugging**: CTEs can be tested independently by commenting out the main query
3. **Maintainability**: Changing the threshold from $5,000 to $10,000 requires editing only one location in the CTE
4. **Reusability**: The same CTE can be used for multiple analyses (regional summary, customer details, etc.)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting the comma between multiple CTEs in the WITH clause
- Using HAVING without GROUP BY (though SQL Server allows it, it's confusing)
- Not testing the CTE independently before building the complete query
- Choosing generic CTE names like "temp1" instead of descriptive names

### Business Applications
- Customer segmentation for targeted marketing campaigns
- Regional performance analysis for sales territory planning
- Customer lifetime value calculations for loyalty programs

### Interview Preparation
**Q**: "When would you choose CTEs over subqueries?"
**A**: "CTEs provide better readability, easier debugging, and can be referenced multiple times. I use them when the business logic is complex or when I need to test components independently."

        COALESCE(eem.EmailOpenRate, 0) AS EmailOpenRate
    FROM CustomerPurchaseMetrics cpm

                (EmailOpenRate * 0.6) + 
                (CASE WHEN EmailsSent > 0 THEN (LinksClicked * 100.0 / EmailsSent) * 0.4 ELSE 0 END), 
                1
            )
        END AS EngagementScore

-- Advanced Challenge: Quarterly trends
WITH 
QuarterlyCustomerTrends AS (

            )
        END AS QuarterOverQuarterGrowth
    FROM QuarterlyCustomerTrends
)
SELECT * FROM CustomerGrowthTrends
ORDER BY CustomerName, OrderYear, OrderQuarter;
```

### Expected Results
```
CustomerName     | Region     | CustomerSegment | TotalSpent | EmailOpenRate | EngagementScore
-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|----------------
Enterprise Ltd   | Northeast  | High Value      | 6100.00    | 100.00        | 80.0
Global Industries| West       | High Value      | 6000.00    | 66.67         | 53.3
Acme Corp       | Northeast  | Medium Value    | 5200.00    | 66.67         | 46.7
Tech Solutions  | Midwest    | Low Value       | 2000.00    | 50.00         | 30.0
StartUp Inc     | South      | Inactive        | 1100.00    | 0.00          | 0.0
```

### Key Learning Points
1. **Progressive Refinement**: Each CTE builds upon the previous one, adding more sophisticated analysis
2. **Business Logic Separation**: Complex segmentation rules are clearly separated from data retrieval
3. **Null Handling**: COALESCE and LEFT JOINs handle customers with missing email data
4. **Calculated Fields**: Engagement scores combine multiple metrics into actionable insights

### Business Applications
- **Marketing Automation**: Trigger different campaigns based on customer segments
- **Customer Success**: Identify at-risk customers before they churn
- **Revenue Optimization**: Focus high-touch sales efforts on High Value prospects

### Advanced Challenge Insights
- Quarterly analysis reveals customer spending patterns and seasonality
- Growth trends identify customers increasing or decreasing their engagement
- Product category preferences help personalize marketing messages

### Interview Preparation
**Q**: "How would you handle a customer who has high spending but low email engagement?"
**A**: "The segmentation logic accounts for this - they'd be classified as 'Medium Value' based on spending alone. I'd recommend alternative engagement channels like phone outreach or direct mail."

## Exercise 3 Solution: Refactoring Complex Nested Queries

### Complete Refactored Solution
```sql
-- Clean, readable CTE-based version of the legacy query
WITH 
-- Step 1: Identify high-performing regions (>$5,000 in orders)
HighPerformingRegions AS (
    SELECT 
        c.Region,
        SUM(o.OrderTotal) AS RegionTotal
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
    WHERE o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'

    ) original_results
    UNION ALL
    -- New CTE version results

SELECT 
    Region,
    RegionTotal,
    'High performing region with >' + CAST(RegionTotal AS VARCHAR) + ' in orders' AS BusinessMeaning
FROM HighPerformingRegions
ORDER BY RegionTotal DESC;
```

### Business Question Analysis
The refactored query answers these key business questions:
1. **Which regions are our top markets?** - Northeast ($11,300) and West ($6,000)
2. **What are the best-selling products in each category for these regions?** - Top 2 per category
3. **How much revenue do our star products generate?** - Specific revenue figures by product

### Expected Results
```
ProductName              | Category | TotalQuantity | TotalRevenue | CategoryRank
-------------------------|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------
Premium Software License| Software | 8             | 9600.00      | 1
Basic Software License  | Software | 5             | 2000.00      | 2
Training Package        | Services | 2             | 1600.00      | 1  
Consulting Hours        | Services | 32            | 4800.00      | 2
```

### Key Learning Points
1. **Readability Transformation**: Complex nested logic becomes self-explaining with descriptive CTE names
2. **Maintainability**: Changing the region threshold from $5,000 to $7,000 requires editing only one line
3. **Debugging Capability**: Each CTE can be tested independently to verify business logic
4. **Code Reviews**: Version control diffs clearly show which business rule changed

### Refactoring Benefits Demonstrated
- **Before**: 15 lines of hard-to-read nested subqueries
- **After**: 4 clearly named business concepts with explicit logic
- **Debugging**: Can verify "HighPerformingRegions" returns Northeast and West as expected
- **Modification**: Easy to adjust thresholds, add filters, or change ranking criteria

### Common Refactoring Mistakes to Avoid
- Choosing vague CTE names like "step1", "temp_data" instead of business-meaningful names
- Not testing each CTE independently during refactoring
- Failing to verify that refactored query returns identical results to original
- Over-engineering with too many CTEs for simple logic

### Production Deployment Checklist
1. ✅ Verify identical results between old and new queries
2. ✅ Test with different parameter values (region thresholds, date ranges)
3. ✅ Confirm performance is comparable or better
4. ✅ Add appropriate comments explaining business logic
5. ✅ Update any dependent reports or procedures

2. **Code Reusability**: Base CTEs can support multiple different analyses
3. **Performance Optimization**: Early filtering in base CTEs reduces processing overhead  
4. **Business Alignment**: CTE names directly reflect business concepts

### Business Applications
- **Customer Success**: Identify at-risk high-value customers
- **Sales Strategy**: Focus efforts on regions and products with highest returns
- **Support Optimization**: Track satisfaction metrics and resolution times
- **Executive Reporting**: Provide comprehensive business health overview

### Interview Preparation
**Q**: "How would you design a query pipeline for a monthly business review?"
**A**: "I'd use a branching CTE structure with a comprehensive base dataset, then create parallel branches for sales metrics, customer analysis, and operational KPIs, concluding with an executive summary that combines key insights."

## Exercise 5 Solution: Performance Analysis and Optimization

### Part A: Execution Plan Analysis Solution
```sql
-- First, let's analyze the problematic query with ACTUAL execution plan enabled
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;

-- Problematic query for analysis (from exercise setup)

    FROM Products p
    LEFT JOIN OrderItems oi ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN Orders o ON oi.OrderID = o.OrderID
    -- Problem: OR condition prevents index usage
    WHERE o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01' OR o.OrderDate IS NULL

    FROM CustomerOrderSummary cos
    CROSS JOIN ProductPerformance pp  -- This creates CustomerCount × ProductCount rows!
    WHERE cos.TotalSpent > 1000
    AND pp.TotalRevenue > 500
)
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM CombinedAnalysis
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC, TotalRevenue DESC;
```

### Part B: Optimized Query Solutions

#### Solution 1: Optimized CTE Implementation
```sql
-- Optimized CTE version addressing all performance issues
WITH 
-- Optimize: Add early date filtering, improve join conditions

        AVG(o.OrderTotal) as AvgOrderValue
    FROM Customers c
    LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID 
        AND o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'  -- Move filter to JOIN for better optimization
    GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.Region
    HAVING SUM(COALESCE(o.OrderTotal, 0)) > 1000  -- Early filtering
),
-- Optimize: Fix OR condition, add proper filtering
ProductPerformance AS (
    SELECT 
        p.ProductID,
        p.ProductName,
        p.Category,
        COUNT(oi.OrderItemID) as TimesSold,
        SUM(oi.Quantity) as TotalQuantity,
        SUM(oi.Quantity * oi.UnitPrice) as TotalRevenue
    FROM Products p
    LEFT JOIN OrderItems oi ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
    LEFT JOIN Orders o ON oi.OrderID = o.OrderID AND o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.Category  
    HAVING SUM(COALESCE(oi.Quantity * oi.UnitPrice, 0)) > 500  -- Early filtering
),
-- Fix: Replace cartesian product with meaningful business logic
CustomerProductInsights AS (
    -- Show customers and their purchased products (actual relationship)
    SELECT 
        cos.Region,
        cos.CustomerName,
        cos.TotalSpent,
        pp.ProductName,
        pp.TotalRevenue,
        pp.Category
    FROM CustomerOrderSummary cos
    JOIN Orders o ON cos.CustomerID = o.CustomerID AND o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
    JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID
    JOIN ProductPerformance pp ON oi.ProductID = pp.ProductID
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    Region,
    CustomerName,
    TotalSpent,
    ProductName,
    Category,
    TotalRevenue
FROM CustomerProductInsights
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC, TotalRevenue DESC;

-- Performance comparison query
SELECT 
    'Optimized CTE Results' AS QueryType,
    COUNT(*) AS RowCount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Region) AS UniqueRegions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerName) AS UniqueCustomers
FROM CustomerProductInsights;
```

#### Solution 2: Subquery Alternative for Comparison
```sql
-- Traditional subquery approach for performance comparison  
SELECT DISTINCT
    customer_data.Region,
    customer_data.CustomerName,
    customer_data.TotalSpent,
    product_data.ProductName,
    product_data.TotalRevenue
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.CustomerID,
        c.CustomerName,
        c.Region,
        SUM(o.OrderTotal) as TotalSpent
    FROM Customers c
    JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
    WHERE o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.Region
    HAVING SUM(o.OrderTotal) > 1000
) customer_data
JOIN Orders o2 ON customer_data.CustomerID = o2.CustomerID
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o2.OrderID = oi.OrderID
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        p.ProductID,
        p.ProductName,
        SUM(oi2.Quantity * oi2.UnitPrice) as TotalRevenue
    FROM Products p
    JOIN OrderItems oi2 ON p.ProductID = oi2.ProductID
    JOIN Orders o3 ON oi2.OrderID = o3.OrderID
    WHERE o3.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
    HAVING SUM(oi2.Quantity * oi2.UnitPrice) > 500
) product_data ON oi.ProductID = product_data.ProductID
WHERE o2.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY customer_data.TotalSpent DESC, product_data.TotalRevenue DESC;
```

#### Solution 3: Temp Table Materialization Strategy
```sql
-- Temp table approach for when CTEs are referenced multiple times
-- Step 1: Materialize customer summary
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CustomerName,
    c.Region,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) as OrderCount,
    SUM(o.OrderTotal) as TotalSpent,
    AVG(o.OrderTotal) as AvgOrderValue
INTO #CustomerSummary
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID 
    AND o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, c.Region
HAVING SUM(COALESCE(o.OrderTotal, 0)) > 1000;

-- Step 2: Create index on temp table for performance
CREATE INDEX IX_CustomerSummary_CustomerID ON #CustomerSummary(CustomerID);
CREATE INDEX IX_CustomerSummary_TotalSpent ON #CustomerSummary(TotalSpent DESC);

-- Step 3: Materialize product performance  
SELECT 
    p.ProductID,
    p.ProductName,
    p.Category,
    SUM(oi.Quantity * oi.UnitPrice) as TotalRevenue
INTO #ProductPerformance
FROM Products p
JOIN OrderItems oi ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
JOIN Orders o ON oi.OrderID = o.OrderID
WHERE o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.Category
HAVING SUM(oi.Quantity * oi.UnitPrice) > 500;

-- Step 4: Create index on product temp table
CREATE INDEX IX_ProductPerformance_ProductID ON #ProductPerformance(ProductID);

-- Step 5: Final query using materialized data
SELECT DISTINCT
    cs.Region,
    cs.CustomerName,
    cs.TotalSpent,
    pp.ProductName,
    pp.TotalRevenue
FROM #CustomerSummary cs
JOIN Orders o ON cs.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID  
JOIN #ProductPerformance pp ON oi.ProductID = pp.ProductID
WHERE o.OrderDate >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY cs.TotalSpent DESC, pp.TotalRevenue DESC;

-- Cleanup
DROP TABLE #CustomerSummary;
DROP TABLE #ProductPerformance;
```

### Part C: Performance Analysis and Comparison
```sql
-- Performance testing framework
DECLARE @StartTime DATETIME2 = GETDATE();
DECLARE @EndTime DATETIME2;

-- Test CTE version
WITH CTETest AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as RecordCount FROM (
        -- Insert optimized CTE query here
        SELECT 1 as TestColumn -- Placeholder
    ) cte_results
)
SELECT 'CTE Version' as QueryType, RecordCount FROM CTETest;

SET @EndTime = GETDATE();
SELECT 'CTE Execution Time (ms)' as Metric, DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTime, @EndTime) as Value;

-- Reset timer for subquery test
SET @StartTime = GETDATE();

-- Test subquery version
SELECT 'Subquery Version' as QueryType, COUNT(*) as RecordCount FROM (
    -- Insert subquery version here
    SELECT 1 as TestColumn -- Placeholder  
) subquery_results;

SET @EndTime = GETDATE();
SELECT 'Subquery Execution Time (ms)' as Metric, DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTime, @EndTime) as Value;

-- Memory and I/O statistics comparison
SELECT 
    'Performance Comparison Summary' as Analysis,
    'CTE version should show better readability and similar performance' as Recommendation,
    'Temp table version best for multiple references' as AlternativeUse;
```

### Performance Issues Identified and Fixed

#### Issues Found:
1. **Cartesian Product**: CROSS JOIN created 5 customers × 5 products = 25 unnecessary combinations
2. **Inefficient OR Conditions**: `WHERE date >= X OR date IS NULL` prevents index usage
3. **Late Filtering**: Large intermediate result sets before filtering
4. **Missing Index Utilization**: Queries not using available indexes optimally

#### Optimizations Applied:
1. **Fixed Join Logic**: Replaced CROSS JOIN with proper business relationship JOIN
2. **Early Filtering**: Moved WHERE conditions to JOIN clauses and added HAVING clauses
3. **Index-Friendly Queries**: Eliminated OR conditions that prevent index seeks
4. **Result Set Reduction**: Applied filters earlier in the CTE chain

### Expected Performance Results
- **Original Query**: ~25 rows (5×5 cartesian product), high I/O, table scans
- **Optimized CTE**: ~8 rows (actual customer-product relationships), index seeks, lower I/O
- **Temp Table Version**: Similar performance to CTE, but better for multiple references

### Key Learning Points
1. **Execution Plan Reading**: Identify expensive operations, table scans, and missing indexes
2. **CTE Optimization**: Early filtering and proper join conditions critical for performance
3. **Business Logic**: Cartesian products rarely represent real business relationships
4. **Index Usage**: Query structure determines whether indexes can be utilized effectively

### Interview Preparation
**Q**: "How would you troubleshoot a slow CTE-based query?"
**A**: "I'd start by examining the execution plan for table scans, expensive operations, and missing statistics. Then I'd check for cartesian products, late filtering, and opportunities to use existing indexes. Finally, I'd consider whether materialization with temp tables would benefit queries with multiple CTE references."

### Key Learning Points

1. **Complex Business Rule Implementation**: Multi-criteria logic using CASE statements and CTEs
2. **Data Quality Handling**: COALESCE and LEFT JOINs handle missing engagement/support data
3. **Modular Design**: Each business rule component in its own CTE for maintainability
4. **Performance Optimization**: Early filtering for eligible customers only
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear logic documentation for business rule validation

### Business Applications

1. **Customer Retention**: Tier protection prevents customer dissatisfaction from sudden tier drops
2. **Marketing Segmentation**: Different communication strategies for each tier
3. **Revenue Optimization**: Focus high-touch efforts on Platinum/Gold customers
4. **Program ROI**: Track engagement improvements and spending increases by tier

### Advanced Rule Validation
```sql
-- Validation: Ensure all eligible customers are classified
WITH ValidationCheck AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS EligibleCustomers,
        SUM(CASE WHEN CurrentTier NOT IN ('Not Eligible', 'New Customer - Evaluation Period') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ClassifiedCustomers
    FROM TierClassification
    WHERE EligibleForProgram = 1
)
SELECT 
    EligibleCustomers,
    ClassifiedCustomers,
    CASE WHEN EligibleCustomers = ClassifiedCustomers THEN 'PASS' ELSE 'FAIL' END AS ValidationResult
FROM ValidationCheck;
```

### Interview Preparation

**Q**: "How would you implement a loyalty program with complex, multi-criteria rules?"
**A**: "I'd break down the business logic into discrete CTEs - eligibility assessment, engagement scoring, tier classification, and bonus calculations. Each CTE represents a single business concept, making the logic easy to validate, modify, and explain to stakeholders. The modular approach also allows for independent testing of each rule set."

**Q**: "How would you handle changing business rules in this system?"
**A**: "The CTE structure makes rule changes straightforward - tier thresholds, bonus calculations, and eligibility criteria are isolated in specific CTEs. Version control shows exactly which business rules changed, and each component can be tested independently before deployment."

This comprehensive solution demonstrates enterprise-level SQL skills, complex business logic implementation, and the kind of sophisticated data analysis that distinguishes senior data engineering candidates.
