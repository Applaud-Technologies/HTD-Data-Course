# SQL ETL Pipeline Patterns

## Introduction

SQL transforms from a simple query tool into a complete ETL powerhouse when you apply the right patterns and techniques. As a developer with database experience, you already understand the basics of data access and manipulation. Now it's time to leverage that foundation to build robust, production-ready data pipelines using SQL's advanced features. 

Stored procedures, views, and transaction management form the backbone of efficient ETL processes that can handle complex transformations at scale. These skills immediately differentiate you from other candidates when applying for data engineering positions, as they demonstrate your ability to build maintainable, reliable data workflows using pure SQL approaches. Let's explore how these database components become powerful building blocks for professional-grade ETL solutions.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Implement stored procedures that execute multi-step data transformations with modular design, conditional logic, and robust error handling mechanisms.
2. Apply views and materialized views as staging mechanisms by creating appropriate abstraction layers and selecting view types based on performance requirements.
3. Implement transaction management across ETL steps to ensure data consistency, handle errors with proper rollback mechanisms, and design idempotent operations.


## Stored Procedures for Multi-Step Transformations

### Building Modular ETL Components

**Focus:** Breaking complex transformations into manageable, reusable procedures

As a Java developer, you understand the importance of well-designed methods. Each method should do one thing and do it well. The same principle applies to stored procedures in ETL workflows.

Good ETL procedures follow the single responsibility principle you already use in Java. Each procedure should handle one specific transformation task. This makes your code easier to test, debug, and maintain.

Here's how to create modular ETL components:

```sql
-- Example: A modular procedure that transforms customer data
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.TransformCustomerData
    @SourceTable VARCHAR(100),
    @DestinationTable VARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    -- Transformation logic here
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[DestinationTable]
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        UPPER(FirstName) AS FirstName,  -- Standardize first name
        UPPER(LastName) AS LastName,    -- Standardize last name
        CASE                            -- Create customer segment
            WHEN TotalPurchases > 10000 THEN 'Premium'
            WHEN TotalPurchases > 5000 THEN 'Gold'
            ELSE 'Standard'
        END AS CustomerSegment
    FROM [dbo].[SourceTable];
END;
```

Notice how this procedure:
- Takes parameters for flexible reuse across different tables
- Focuses on just one transformation (customer data standardization)
- Has a clear naming convention that indicates its purpose

When interviewing for data engineering positions, you'll often be asked about your approach to ETL design. Employers value candidates who can break down complex transformations into manageable components. This demonstrates your ability to create maintainable data pipelines.

### Controlling Execution Flow

**Focus:** Implementing conditional logic within SQL procedures

You're familiar with control flow in Javaâ€”if statements, loops, and switches. SQL procedures offer similar control structures for your ETL workflows.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ProcessSalesData
    @ProcessDate DATE
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @RecordCount INT;
    
    -- Check if data exists for the given date
    SELECT @RecordCount = COUNT(*) 
    FROM [Sales].[RawData]
    WHERE SaleDate = @ProcessDate;
    
    -- Conditional processing based on data availability
    IF @RecordCount > 0
    BEGIN
        -- Process existing data
        INSERT INTO [Sales].[ProcessedSales]
        SELECT 
            SaleID,
            ProductID,
            Amount,
            SaleDate
        FROM [Sales].[RawData]
        WHERE SaleDate = @ProcessDate;
        
        PRINT 'Processed ' + CAST(@RecordCount AS VARCHAR) + ' sales records';
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        -- Log when no data is available
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ProcessLog] (ProcessDate, Message)
        VALUES (@ProcessDate, 'No sales data found for processing');
        
        PRINT 'No data found for ' + CAST(@ProcessDate AS VARCHAR);
    END
END;
```

This procedure demonstrates:
- IF/ELSE conditions to handle different data scenarios
- Dynamic message generation based on processing results
- Logging of processing outcomes

You can also use WHILE loops for iterative processing:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ProcessBatchedData
    @BatchSize INT = 1000
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @RowsToProcess INT;
    
    SELECT @RowsToProcess = COUNT(*) FROM [StagingData].[NewRecords];
    
    WHILE @RowsToProcess > 0
    BEGIN
        -- Process one batch
        INSERT INTO [Warehouse].[FinalData]
        SELECT TOP (@BatchSize) * 
        FROM [StagingData].[NewRecords]
        ORDER BY RecordID;
        
        -- Remove processed records
        DELETE TOP (@BatchSize) 
        FROM [StagingData].[NewRecords]
        ORDER BY RecordID;
        
        -- Update counter
        SET @RowsToProcess = @RowsToProcess - @BatchSize;
        
        PRINT 'Remaining records: ' + CAST(@RowsToProcess AS VARCHAR);
    END
END;
```

In job interviews, you might be asked about handling large data volumes. Showing knowledge of batch processing demonstrates your understanding of efficient ETL practices. This skill translates directly to real-world data pipeline development.

### Error Handling in Transformation Procedures

**Focus:** Capturing and responding to errors during ETL execution

In Java, you use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. SQL Server provides TRY-CATCH blocks for similar error handling in stored procedures.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SafeDataTransform
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;
            
        -- Transformation logic
        INSERT INTO [Warehouse].[ProductDimension]
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
            ProductName,
            Category,
            Price
        FROM [Staging].[ProductData];
            
        -- More transformation steps...
            
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        
        -- Log successful execution
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ProcessLog] (ProcedureName, ExecutionTime, Status)
        VALUES ('SafeDataTransform', GETDATE(), 'Success');
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Roll back any changes
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            
        -- Log the error details
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ErrorLog] (
            ProcedureName,
            ErrorNumber,
            ErrorSeverity,
            ErrorState,
            ErrorLine,
            ErrorMessage,
            ErrorTime
        )
        VALUES (
            'SafeDataTransform',
            ERROR_NUMBER(),
            ERROR_SEVERITY(),
            ERROR_STATE(),
            ERROR_LINE(),
            ERROR_MESSAGE(),
            GETDATE()
        );
        
        -- Return error information
        SELECT 'Error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorResult;
    END CATCH
END;
```

Proper error handling demonstrates production-readiness, which is crucial for data engineering roles. When things go wrong (and they will), your ETL process should:
- Capture detailed error information
- Roll back incomplete transactions
- Log errors for troubleshooting
- Communicate failures clearly

Hiring managers specifically look for these error-handling patterns in technical interviews. They show you understand the realities of production data systems.

## Views and Materialized Views for Staging

### Creating Transformation Abstraction Layers

**Focus:** Using views to simplify complex transformations

You've already learned about database views in Week 1. In ETL workflows, views serve as powerful abstraction layers for your transformation logic.

Views let you break complex transformations into logical steps:

```sql
-- Step 1: Cleanse and standardize customer data
CREATE VIEW [ETL].[CleanCustomerData] AS
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    TRIM(FirstName) AS FirstName,
    TRIM(LastName) AS LastName,
    CASE 
        WHEN LEN(PhoneNumber) = 10 THEN 
            '(' + SUBSTRING(PhoneNumber, 1, 3) + ') ' + 
            SUBSTRING(PhoneNumber, 4, 3) + '-' + 
            SUBSTRING(PhoneNumber, 7, 4)
        ELSE PhoneNumber
    END AS FormattedPhone,
    LOWER(EmailAddress) AS EmailAddress
FROM [Raw].[CustomerImport];

-- Step 2: Enrich with geographic information
CREATE VIEW [ETL].[EnrichedCustomerData] AS
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.FirstName,
    c.LastName,
    c.FormattedPhone,
    c.EmailAddress,
    g.Region,
    g.TimeZone,
    g.SalesTerritory
FROM [ETL].[CleanCustomerData] c
JOIN [Reference].[Geography] g ON c.ZipCode = g.ZipCode;

-- Step 3: Final customer dimension view
CREATE VIEW [ETL].[CustomerDimension] AS
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    FormattedPhone AS PhoneNumber,
    EmailAddress,
    Region,
    TimeZone,
    SalesTerritory,
    GETDATE() AS ETLProcessDate
FROM [ETL].[EnrichedCustomerData];
```

This staged approach using views:
- Makes complex logic easier to understand
- Creates clear documentation of your transformation steps
- Allows testing at each transformation stage
- Simplifies troubleshooting when issues arise

In data engineering interviews, you may be asked to design a multi-step transformation. Using views as staging layers shows you understand how to create maintainable ETL processes.

### Selecting View Types for Performance

**Focus:** Choosing between regular and materialized views

SQL Server offers two main types of views for your ETL processes:
1. Regular views (virtual tables that execute their query each time)
2. Indexed views (materialized views that store actual data)

Regular views are perfect for:
- Simple transformations
- When source data changes frequently
- When storage space is limited

```sql
-- Regular view example
CREATE VIEW [Sales].[MonthlySummary] AS
SELECT 
    YEAR(SaleDate) AS SaleYear,
    MONTH(SaleDate) AS SaleMonth,
    ProductCategory,
    SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS UniqueCustomers
FROM [Sales].[Transactions]
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(SaleDate),
    MONTH(SaleDate),
    ProductCategory;
```

Indexed (materialized) views store actual data and are ideal for:
- Complex calculations that are expensive to repeat
- Frequently accessed transformations
- When query performance is critical

```sql
-- Indexed view example
CREATE VIEW [Sales].[ProductPerformanceMatrix]
WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT 
    p.ProductID,
    p.ProductName,
    p.Category,
    COUNT_BIG(*) AS TransactionCount,
    SUM(t.Amount) AS TotalRevenue,
    SUM(t.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM [dbo].[Products] p
JOIN [dbo].[Transactions] t ON p.ProductID = t.ProductID
GROUP BY 
    p.ProductID,
    p.ProductName,
    p.Category;

-- Create unique clustered index to materialize the view
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IDX_ProductPerformance 
ON [Sales].[ProductPerformanceMatrix] (ProductID);
```

Understanding when to use each type demonstrates your awareness of performance considerations. Hiring managers value candidates who can make these practical design decisions to balance performance and resource usage.

### Managing View Dependencies

**Focus:** Designing view hierarchies for complex transformations

When building ETL pipelines with views, you create dependency chains. Managing these dependencies is crucial for maintaining your transformation logic.

```sql
-- Track view dependencies with system information
SELECT 
    parent.name AS ParentView,
    child.name AS DependentView
FROM sys.views parent
JOIN sys.sql_expression_dependencies dep ON parent.object_id = dep.referenced_id
JOIN sys.views child ON dep.referencing_id = child.object_id
ORDER BY parent.name, child.name;
```

When modifying base views, consider impact analysis:

```sql
-- Find all objects that depend on a specific view
DECLARE @ViewName NVARCHAR(128) = 'ETL.CleanCustomerData';

SELECT 
    o.name AS DependentObject,
    o.type_desc AS ObjectType
FROM sys.objects o
JOIN sys.sql_expression_dependencies dep ON o.object_id = dep.referencing_id
JOIN sys.objects base ON dep.referenced_id = base.object_id
WHERE base.name = @ViewName;
```

To test view chains effectively:
1. Validate each view individually before testing dependent views
2. Create test cases that verify data flows correctly through the chain
3. Document the expected output of each transformation step

```sql
-- Validate a view's output meets expectations
DECLARE @ExpectedCount INT = 1000;
DECLARE @ActualCount INT;

SELECT @ActualCount = COUNT(*) FROM [ETL].[CustomerDimension];

IF @ActualCount <> @ExpectedCount
    PRINT 'Validation failed: Expected ' + CAST(@ExpectedCount AS VARCHAR) + 
          ' records but found ' + CAST(@ActualCount AS VARCHAR);
ELSE
    PRINT 'Validation passed!';
```

Understanding view dependencies is particularly valuable in enterprise environments. During interviews, being able to discuss dependency management shows you can work with complex, production-grade ETL processes.

## Transaction Management Across ETL Steps

### Ensuring Data Consistency

**Focus:** Maintaining data integrity during multi-step processes

Transaction management is critical for data consistency in ETL processes. You need to ensure that related data changes happen completely or not at all.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.UpdateProductCatalog
AS
BEGIN
    -- Begin a single transaction for all related changes
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Step 1: Archive old product data
        INSERT INTO [Archive].[Products]
        SELECT p.*, GETDATE() AS ArchivedDate
        FROM [Product].[Catalog] p
        WHERE p.IsDiscontinued = 1;
        
        -- Step 2: Remove discontinued products
        DELETE FROM [Product].[Catalog]
        WHERE IsDiscontinued = 1;
        
        -- Step 3: Insert new products
        INSERT INTO [Product].[Catalog]
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
            ProductName,
            Category,
            Price,
            0 AS IsDiscontinued
        FROM [Staging].[NewProducts];
        
        -- All steps completed successfully, commit the transaction
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        
        PRINT 'Product catalog updated successfully.';
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- If any step fails, roll back all changes
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            
        PRINT 'Error updating product catalog: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
        
        -- Rethrow the error
        THROW;
    END CATCH
END;
```

For complex ETL processes, you can use savepoints to create checkpoints within longer transactions:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ComplexDataMigration
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Step 1: Migrate customer data
        INSERT INTO [NewDB].[Customers]
        SELECT * FROM [OldDB].[Customers];
        
        -- Create a savepoint after customer migration
        SAVE TRANSACTION CustomersCompleted;
        
        -- Step 2: Migrate order data
        INSERT INTO [NewDB].[Orders]
        SELECT * FROM [OldDB].[Orders];
        
        -- Create another savepoint
        SAVE TRANSACTION OrdersCompleted;
        
        -- Step 3: Migrate product data
        INSERT INTO [NewDB].[Products]
        SELECT * FROM [OldDB].[Products];
        
        -- All steps completed, commit everything
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Check which step failed and roll back accordingly
        IF ERROR_MESSAGE() LIKE '%Products%'
        BEGIN
            -- Roll back to the last good savepoint
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION OrdersCompleted;
            -- Try to salvage the customer and order migrations
            COMMIT TRANSACTION;
            PRINT 'Salvaged customer and order migrations.';
        END
        ELSE
        BEGIN
            -- More severe error, roll back everything
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            PRINT 'Complete rollback performed.';
        END
        
        PRINT 'Error during migration: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END CATCH
END;
```

Transaction management skills are foundational for data engineering roles. Interviewers will be looking for your understanding of how to maintain data consistency during complex ETL operations.

### Error Handling with Transaction Rollback

**Focus:** Implementing proper error recovery

Effective error handling with proper transaction management shows you understand production-ready ETL design.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.LoadDailySales
    @BusinessDate DATE
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables for error handling
    DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000);
    DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT;
    DECLARE @ErrorState INT;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Start transaction
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;
        
        -- Delete any existing data for this date (makes the process re-runnable)
        DELETE FROM [Warehouse].[DailySales]
        WHERE BusinessDate = @BusinessDate;
        
        -- Insert new sales data
        INSERT INTO [Warehouse].[DailySales] (
            BusinessDate,
            StoreID,
            ProductID,
            QuantitySold,
            TotalRevenue
        )
        SELECT 
            @BusinessDate,
            StoreID,
            ProductID,
            SUM(Quantity),
            SUM(Amount)
        FROM [Source].[SalesTransactions]
        WHERE CAST(TransactionDate AS DATE) = @BusinessDate
        GROUP BY StoreID, ProductID;
        
        -- If we get here, commit the transaction
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        
        -- Log successful execution
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ProcessLog] (
            ProcedureName,
            ExecutionDate,
            RowsProcessed,
            Status
        )
        VALUES (
            'LoadDailySales',
            GETDATE(),
            @@ROWCOUNT,
            'Success'
        );
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Capture error details
        SELECT 
            @ErrorMessage = ERROR_MESSAGE(),
            @ErrorSeverity = ERROR_SEVERITY(),
            @ErrorState = ERROR_STATE();
        
        -- Roll back any open transaction
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            
        -- Log the error details
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ErrorLog] (
            ProcedureName,
            ExecutionDate,
            ErrorMessage,
            ErrorSeverity,
            ErrorState
        )
        VALUES (
            'LoadDailySales',
            GETDATE(),
            @ErrorMessage,
            @ErrorSeverity,
            @ErrorState
        );
        
        -- Re-throw the error with additional context
        RAISERROR('Error in LoadDailySales for date %s: %s', 
                 @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorState, 
                 @BusinessDate, @ErrorMessage);
    END CATCH
END;
```

This approach provides:
- Comprehensive error capture and logging
- Proper transaction rollback to prevent partial updates
- Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting
- Status logging for monitoring ETL processes

In job interviews, employers specifically look for candidates who understand how to handle errors properly. This skill separates entry-level candidates from those ready for production responsibilities.

### Designing Idempotent Operations

**Focus:** Creating ETL processes that can be safely rerun

Just as RESTful APIs should be idempotent, ETL processes should produce the same result regardless of how many times they run. This is essential for reliable data pipelines.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.UpdateProductInventory
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;
        
        -- Clean staging table before loading new data
        TRUNCATE TABLE [Staging].[InventoryUpdates];
        
        -- Load new data into staging
        INSERT INTO [Staging].[InventoryUpdates]
        SELECT * FROM [External].[InventoryFeed];
        
        -- Apply updates using MERGE - idempotent operation
        MERGE [Warehouse].[ProductInventory] AS target
        USING [Staging].[InventoryUpdates] AS source
        ON target.ProductID = source.ProductID
        
        -- When matched, update existing inventory
        WHEN MATCHED THEN
            UPDATE SET 
                target.QuantityOnHand = source.QuantityOnHand,
                target.LastUpdated = GETDATE()
                
        -- When not matched, insert new product inventory
        WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
            INSERT (ProductID, QuantityOnHand, LastUpdated)
            VALUES (source.ProductID, source.QuantityOnHand, GETDATE());
        
        COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        
        -- Log successful execution
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ProcessLog] (Process, ExecutionTime, Status)
        VALUES ('UpdateProductInventory', GETDATE(), 'Success');
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            
        -- Log error
        INSERT INTO [ETL].[ErrorLog] (Process, ExecutionTime, ErrorMessage)
        VALUES ('UpdateProductInventory', GETDATE(), ERROR_MESSAGE());
        
        -- Re-throw
        THROW;
    END CATCH
END;
```

Key idempotency techniques demonstrated:
- Clearing staging tables before loading new data
- Using MERGE operations that handle both inserts and updates
- Including verification checks before critical operations
- Cleanup of temporary objects after processing

Idempotent ETL operations are highly valued in production environments. During interviews, mentioning your experience with designing idempotent processes will demonstrate your readiness for real-world data engineering tasks.

## Hands-On Practice

Let's put everything together by building a complete ETL pipeline for sales data aggregation.

```sql
-- Step 1: Create staging views
CREATE VIEW [ETL].[SalesDataCleaned] AS
SELECT 
    TransactionID,
    CAST(TransactionDate AS DATE) AS SaleDate,
    StoreID,
    CashierID,
    CustomerID,
    ProductID,
    Quantity,
    UnitPrice,
    Quantity * UnitPrice AS TotalAmount,
    PaymentMethod
FROM [Raw].[SalesTransactions]
WHERE TransactionID IS NOT NULL
AND TransactionDate IS NOT NULL
AND ProductID IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 2: Create aggregation views
CREATE VIEW [ETL].[DailySalesByProduct] AS
SELECT 
    SaleDate,
    ProductID,
    SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalRevenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT TransactionID) AS TransactionCount
FROM [ETL].[SalesDataCleaned]
GROUP BY 
    SaleDate,
    ProductID;

CREATE VIEW [ETL].[DailySalesByStore] AS
SELECT 
    SaleDate,
    StoreID,
    SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalRevenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT TransactionID) AS TransactionCount
FROM [ETL].[SalesDataCleaned]
GROUP BY 
    SaleDate,
    StoreID;

-- Step 3: Create ETL procedure with transaction management
CREATE PROCEDURE [ETL].[ProcessDailySales]
    @BusinessDate DATE = NULL
AS
BEGIN
    -- Default to yesterday if no date provided
    IF @BusinessDate IS NULL
        SET @BusinessDate = DATEADD(DAY, -1, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE));
    
    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;

# Glossary

## Core ETL Concepts

**Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** A data integration pattern that extracts data from source systems, transforms it to meet business requirements, and loads it into a target system like a data warehouse. ETL processes form the backbone of most data engineering workflows.

**Data Pipeline** A series of data processing steps where the output of one step becomes the input of the next. In SQL ETL, pipelines typically consist of stored procedures, views, and transformation logic that move data from raw sources to analytics-ready formats.

**Staging Area** A temporary storage location where data is held during transformation processes. Staging allows for data validation, cleaning, and transformation before loading into final destination tables.

**Data Transformation** The process of converting data from one format, structure, or value set to another. Common transformations include data type conversion, field concatenation, lookup enrichment, and business rule application.

**ETL Pipeline** A complete workflow that orchestrates multiple ETL processes, handling dependencies, error recovery, and monitoring. Modern ETL pipelines are designed to be reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

**Batch Processing** Processing data in discrete chunks or batches rather than one record at a time. Batch processing is efficient for large data volumes and allows for better resource management and error recovery.

## Stored Procedure Architecture

**Modular Design** Breaking complex ETL logic into smaller, focused stored procedures that each handle a specific transformation or business function. Similar to methods in object-oriented programming, each procedure should have a single responsibility.

**Parameterized Procedures** Stored procedures that accept input parameters, making them reusable across different data sets, date ranges, or business scenarios. Parameters increase flexibility and reduce code duplication.

**Control Flow** The use of conditional logic (IF/ELSE), loops (WHILE), and branching within stored procedures to handle different data scenarios and business rules dynamically.

**Procedure Orchestration** The coordination of multiple stored procedures to execute in the correct sequence, handling dependencies and passing data between transformation steps.

**Dynamic SQL** SQL statements constructed and executed at runtime within stored procedures, allowing for flexible table names, column lists, and query structures based on parameters or conditions.

**Execution Context** The environment in which a stored procedure runs, including user permissions, database settings, and transaction state. Understanding execution context is crucial for security and performance.

## Transaction Management

**ACID Properties** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability - the fundamental properties that database transactions must maintain to ensure data integrity in multi-step operations.

**Transaction Scope** The boundary that defines which operations are grouped together as a single unit of work. In ETL, transaction scope determines what gets rolled back if an error occurs.

**Commit** The action that makes all changes within a transaction permanent. Once committed, changes cannot be automatically undone and become visible to other database users.

**Rollback** The action that undoes all changes made within a transaction, returning the database to its state before the transaction began. Essential for error recovery in ETL processes.

**Savepoint** A named checkpoint within a transaction that allows partial rollback to a specific point rather than rolling back the entire transaction. Useful for complex, multi-step ETL processes.

**Transaction Isolation Level** Settings that control how concurrent transactions interact with each other, balancing data consistency with performance. Common levels include READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE.

**Deadlock** A situation where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, creating a circular dependency. ETL processes must be designed to minimize deadlock risk.

## Error Handling and Logging

**TRY-CATCH Block** SQL Server's error handling mechanism that allows graceful handling of exceptions within stored procedures, similar to try-catch blocks in programming languages like Java.

**Error Propagation** The process of passing error information up through the call stack, allowing higher-level procedures to handle or log errors appropriately.

**Error Severity Level** A numeric code indicating the seriousness of an error. Severity levels help determine appropriate response actions, from simple logging to immediate process termination.

**Error State** Additional context information about an error, often used to identify the specific location or condition that caused an error within complex procedures.

**Audit Trail** A record of all changes made to data, including who made the change, when it occurred, and what was modified. Essential for compliance and troubleshooting in production ETL systems.

**Process Log** A record of ETL execution details including start time, end time, rows processed, and completion status. Used for monitoring, performance analysis, and troubleshooting.

**Error Log** A dedicated table or file that stores detailed information about errors that occur during ETL processing, including error messages, timestamps, and affected data.

## View Types and Patterns

**Logical View** A standard database view that represents a virtual table based on a query. The query is executed each time the view is accessed, providing real-time data but potentially slower performance.

**Materialized View (Indexed View)** A view that physically stores its result set on disk and maintains indexes for fast access. Updates automatically when underlying data changes, but requires more storage and maintenance overhead.

**Staging View** A view that represents an intermediate step in data transformation, typically cleaning or standardizing data before final processing. Staging views help break complex transformations into manageable steps.

**Transformation Layer** A collection of views that progressively transform raw data through multiple stages, creating a pipeline of data refinement from source to target format.

**Business Logic View** A view that encapsulates complex business rules and calculations, making them reusable across multiple reports or downstream processes.

**Aggregation View** A view that performs grouping and summarization operations, often used to create summary tables or dashboards from detailed transaction data.

## Data Quality and Validation

**Data Validation** The process of checking data against business rules, constraints, and expected formats to ensure accuracy and completeness before loading into target systems.

**Data Cleansing** The process of identifying and correcting or removing corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant records from a dataset. Common cleansing operations include standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and filling missing values.

**Data Standardization** Converting data to a consistent format across different sources. Examples include formatting phone numbers, addresses, or dates to match established patterns.

**Referential Integrity** Ensuring that relationships between tables remain valid throughout ETL processes. Foreign key constraints and lookup validations help maintain referential integrity.

**Data Profiling** The process of analyzing source data to understand its structure, content, quality, and relationships. Profiling helps identify data quality issues before ETL development.

**Exception Handling** The systematic handling of data that doesn't meet validation criteria, including logging rejected records, applying default values, or routing exceptions for manual review.

## Performance and Optimization

**Bulk Operations** Database operations that process multiple rows in a single statement rather than row-by-row processing. Bulk operations like BULK INSERT or MERGE are typically much faster than cursor-based approaches.

**Index Strategy** The planning and implementation of database indexes to support ETL query performance. Proper indexing on source tables, staging areas, and target tables is crucial for ETL performance.

**Resource Management** The efficient use of CPU, memory, and I/O resources during ETL processing. Includes considerations like batch sizing, parallel processing, and memory allocation.

**Query Optimization** The process of improving SQL query performance through better query structure, join strategies, and index utilization. Query plans help identify optimization opportunities.

**Parallel Processing** Executing multiple ETL operations simultaneously to reduce overall processing time. Can be implemented through multiple stored procedures or within procedures using parallel query execution.

**Memory Management** Controlling how much system memory ETL processes consume, particularly important for large data transformations that might cause memory pressure on database servers.

## Operational Patterns

**Idempotent Operations** ETL processes designed to produce the same result regardless of how many times they're executed. Idempotency is crucial for reliable, re-runnable ETL pipelines.

**Delta Processing** Processing only the data that has changed since the last ETL run, rather than reprocessing all data. Delta processing improves performance and reduces resource consumption.

**Full Refresh** Completely replacing target data with a fresh copy from the source, rather than updating incrementally. Full refresh ensures data consistency but requires more processing time.

**Restart and Recovery** The ability to resume ETL processing from a failure point rather than starting over. Typically implemented through checkpoints, logging, and transaction management.

**Data Lineage** The ability to trace data from its source through various transformation steps to its final destination. Data lineage is essential for debugging, compliance, and impact analysis.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** A technique for identifying and capturing changes made to source data, enabling efficient delta processing in ETL pipelines.

## SQL Server Specific Terms

**@@TRANCOUNT** A system variable that returns the number of active transactions for the current connection. Used to determine if a transaction is already active before beginning a new one.

**@@ROWCOUNT** A system variable that returns the number of rows affected by the last statement. Commonly used for logging and validation in ETL processes.

**MERGE Statement** A SQL statement that performs INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations in a single statement based on matching conditions. Particularly useful for synchronizing staging and target tables.

**OUTPUT Clause** A SQL feature that returns information about rows affected by INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statements. Useful for auditing and logging in ETL processes.

**Common Table Expression (CTE)** A temporary named result set that exists only for the duration of a single SQL statement. CTEs can simplify complex queries and improve readability in ETL transformations.

**SCHEMABINDING** A view or function option that binds the object to the schema of underlying tables, preventing schema changes that would break the object. Required for indexed views.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

**ETL Monitoring** The continuous observation of ETL processes to ensure they complete successfully, meet performance targets, and maintain data quality standards.

**Process Scheduling** The automated execution of ETL processes at predetermined times or intervals, typically managed through SQL Server Agent jobs or external schedulers.

**Alerting** Automated notifications sent when ETL processes fail, exceed time limits, or encounter data quality issues. Alerts enable rapid response to production problems.

**Performance Metrics** Quantitative measures of ETL performance including execution time, throughput (rows per second), resource utilization, and error rates.

**Capacity Planning** The process of forecasting future resource needs based on data growth trends, ensuring ETL systems can handle increasing data volumes.

**Maintenance Windows** Scheduled time periods when ETL processes can run without impacting business operations, often during off-peak hours when system resources are available.

## Business Integration

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)** Formal agreements that define expected ETL performance standards, including maximum execution times, availability requirements, and data freshness requirements.

**Data Freshness** The age of data in target systems relative to when it was created in source systems. Different business processes have different freshness requirements.

**Business Rules Engine** A system or process that applies business logic to data during transformation, often implemented through stored procedures or specialized software.

**Master Data Management (MDM)** The practice of managing critical business data entities (customers, products, locations) to ensure consistency across systems and ETL processes.

**Data Governance** The overall management framework for data assets, including policies, procedures, and responsibilities for data quality, security, and compliance in ETL processes.

# SQL ETL Pipeline Patterns - Progressive Exercises

## Exercise 1: Basic Stored Procedure ETL (Beginner)

**Learning Objective:** Understand how to create simple stored procedures for data transformation, focusing on modular design and basic error handling.

### Scenario

You're working for a small retail company that needs to process daily sales data. Raw sales transactions come from the point-of-sale system in a somewhat messy format, and you need to clean and standardize this data before loading it into the analytics database.

### Sample Data Setup

```sql
-- Create sample tables for the exercise
CREATE TABLE [Raw].[SalesTransactions] (
    TransactionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    SaleDate VARCHAR(20),  -- Inconsistent date formats
    StoreID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Quantity INT,
    UnitPrice DECIMAL(10,2),
    CustomerID INT,
    SalespersonName VARCHAR(50)  -- Mixed case, inconsistent formatting
);

CREATE TABLE [Clean].[SalesTransactions] (
    TransactionID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SaleDate DATE,
    StoreID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Quantity INT,
    UnitPrice DECIMAL(10,2),
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10,2),
    CustomerID INT,
    SalespersonName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE [ETL].[ProcessLog] (
    LogID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProcedureName VARCHAR(100),
    ExecutionTime DATETIME,
    RowsProcessed INT,
    Status VARCHAR(20),
    Message VARCHAR(500)
);

-- Insert sample messy data
INSERT INTO [Raw].[SalesTransactions] VALUES
('2024-01-15', 1, 101, 'Widget A', 2, 25.50, 1001, 'john smith'),
('01/16/2024', 1, 102, 'Widget B', 1, 45.00, 1002, 'JANE DOE'),
('2024-1-17', 2, 101, 'Widget A', 3, 25.50, 1003, 'Bob Johnson'),
('01-18-2024', 2, 103, 'Widget C', 1, 75.25, 1001, 'john smith'),
('2024/01/19', 1, 102, 'Widget B', 2, 45.00, 1004, 'mary wilson');
```

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Create a Data Cleaning Procedure** Create a stored procedure called `CleanSalesData` that:

);

-- Insert reference data
INSERT INTO [Reference].[Products] VALUES
(101, 'Widget A', 'Electronics', 25.50, 1),
(102, 'Widget B', 'Electronics', 45.00, 1),
(103, 'Widget C', 'Home & Garden', 75.25, 1);

INSERT INTO [Reference].[Customers] VALUES
(1001, 'John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@email.com', '555-0101', 'New York', 'NY', 'Premium'),
(1002, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'jane.doe@email.com', '555-0102', 'Los Angeles', 'CA', 'Standard'),
(1003, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob.johnson@email.com', '555-0103', 'Chicago', 'IL', 'Basic'),
(1004, 'Mary', 'Wilson', 'mary.wilson@email.com', '555-0104', 'Houston', 'TX', 'Premium');

INSERT INTO [Reference].[Stores] VALUES
(1, 'Downtown Store', 'East', 'Alice Manager', '2020-01-15'),
(2, 'Mall Location', 'West', 'Bob Manager', '2019-06-01');
```

### Your Tasks

**Task 1: Create Base Cleansing View** Create a view called `[Views].[CleanSalesBase]` that:

- Uses the cleaned sales data from Exercise 1
- Adds basic calculations (margin = TotalAmount - (Quantity Ã— StandardPrice))
- Includes data quality flags for any anomalies

**Task 2: Create Enrichment Views** Build progressive enrichment views:

`[Views].[SalesWithProducts]` - Joins sales with product information `[Views].[SalesWithCustomers]` - Adds customer information `[Views].[SalesWithStores]` - Adds store information

**Task 3: Create Business Logic View** Create `[Views].[SalesAnalytics]` that provides:

- Customer lifetime value calculations
- Product performance metrics
- Regional sales summaries
- Margin analysis by category

### Expected Outcomes

## Exercise 3: Transaction Management in Complex ETL (Intermediate)

**Learning Objective:** Implement comprehensive transaction management with rollback capabilities, savepoints, and proper error recovery.

### Scenario

You need to implement a nightly batch process that updates multiple related tables: customer information, order processing, and inventory adjustments. If any step fails, the entire process must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

### Sample Data Setup

```sql
-- Customer updates staging
CREATE TABLE [Staging].[CustomerUpdates] (
    CustomerID INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),

## Exercise 6: ETL Pipeline Integration and Orchestration (Advanced)

**Learning Objective:** Orchestrate complex ETL workflows with dependencies, parallel processing, and enterprise scheduling integration.

### Scenario

Your ETL system has grown into multiple interconnected pipelines serving different business units. You need to orchestrate these pipelines efficiently, handling dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and integration with enterprise scheduling systems.

### Complex Integration Setup

```sql
-- Pipeline dependency configuration
CREATE TABLE [Config].[PipelineDependencies] (
    DependencyID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    PipelineName VARCHAR(100),
    DependsOnPipeline VARCHAR(100),
    DependencyType VARCHAR(20),  -- SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL, CONDITIONAL
    IsActive BIT
);

-- Pipeline execution status
CREATE TABLE [Runtime].[PipelineExecution] (
    ExecutionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    PipelineName VARCHAR(100),
    ExecutionDate DATE,
    StartTime DATETIME,
    EndTime DATETIME,
    Status VARCHAR(20),  -- RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, WAITING
    ExecutedBy VARCHAR(100),
    Parameters XML
);

-- Data quality metrics
CREATE TABLE [Quality].[DataQualityMetrics] (
    MetricID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    PipelineName VARCHAR(100),
    MetricName VARCHAR(100),
    MetricValue DECIMAL(10,4),
    Threshold DECIMAL(10,4),
    Status VARCHAR(20),  -- PASS, WARN, FAIL
    CheckDate DATETIME
);
```
