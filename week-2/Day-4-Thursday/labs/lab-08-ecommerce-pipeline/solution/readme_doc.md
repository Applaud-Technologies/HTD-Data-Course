   - Verify all 6 tables are created successfully
   - Confirm foreign key relationships are established

3. **Load Sample Data**
   - Import the provided e-commerce CSV data into `stg_orders_raw` table
   - Verify data loaded correctly with basic row count check
   - Expected: 1000+ order records with realistic e-commerce data

4. **Execute ETL Pipeline**
   - Run `etl_pipeline.sql` to process all transformations
   - Monitor console output for processing progress
   - Verify SCD Type 2 creates multiple customer versions

5. **Run Validation Framework**
   - Execute `validation_checks.sql` to verify data quality
   - Review validation results for any failures
   - Address any critical validation failures before proceeding

6. **Execute Analytics Queries**
   - Run `window_functions.sql` to generate business insights
   - Review moving averages, lifetime values, and purchase rankings
   - Verify meaningful business intelligence results

### Expected Results

- **Staging Table**: ~1000 raw order records
- **Fact Table**: ~1000 processed order transactions
- **Customer Dimension**: 150+ records (including SCD Type 2 versions)
- **Product Dimension**: ~30 unique products across multiple categories
- **Date Dimension**: 365+ dates for complete 2024 calendar year
- **Validation Results**: 10 validation checks with pass/fail status

## Schema Design

### Star Schema Overview

This e-commerce data warehouse implements a classic star schema optimized for sales analysis and customer intelligence:

**Central Fact Table**: `fact_orders`
- **Grain**: One row per product per order line item
- **Measures**: quantity, unit_price, discount_amount, total_amount
- **Purpose**: Enables comprehensive sales analysis, product performance tracking, and customer behavior insights

**Dimension Tables**:
- **`dim_customer`**: Customer master data with SCD Type 2 historical tracking
- **`dim_product`**: Product catalog with category and brand information
- **`dim_date`**: Complete calendar dimension with business day indicators

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Surrogate keys used throughout for performance and SCD Type 2 support
- Customer dimension tracks historical changes for accurate trend analysis
- Fact table captures individual line items for detailed product analysis
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal query performance

### Business Rules Applied

**Data Standardization Rules**:
- Customer names converted to proper case format
- Email addresses standardized to lowercase
- Customer segments mapped to exactly 4 standard values (VIP, Premium, Standard, Basic)
- Address formatting standardized with consistent spacing

**Business Logic Rules**:
- **Enhanced Segmentation**: VIP customers in major metropolitan areas (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix) receive 'VIP Metro' designation
- **Order Value Classification**: Orders classified as High Value (≥$500), Medium Value ($100-$499), or Low Value (<$100)
- **Product Margin Analysis**: Products categorized by profit margin percentage for business intelligence

**SCD Type 2 Implementation**:
- Tracks changes in customer name, email, address, and segment
- Maintains complete historical record of customer evolution
- Enables accurate trend analysis and customer lifetime value calculations

## Key Assumptions

### Data Quality Assumptions

- **Source Data Completeness**: Assumed source system provides core required fields (customer_id, customer_name, product_id, order details)
- **Data Format Consistency**: Applied standardization rules to handle common variations in name casing, email formatting, and segment values
- **Date Data Integrity**: Assumed order dates are generally reliable with occasional future date exceptions handled by validation
- **Quantity and Price Validity**: Applied business-reasonable ranges (quantities 1-1000, prices $0.01-$10,000) with validation monitoring

### Business Logic Assumptions

- **Customer Segmentation**: Assumed 4-tier segment structure (VIP, Premium, Standard, Basic) represents complete business classification
- **Geographic Enhancement**: Major metropolitan areas warrant enhanced VIP treatment based on market importance
- **Historical Tracking**: Assumed business value in tracking customer changes over time for retention and growth analysis
- **Product Categorization**: Maintained source system product categories as business-meaningful groupings

### Technical Assumptions

- **Surrogate Key Strategy**: Implemented IDENTITY-based surrogate keys for optimal performance and SCD Type 2 support
- **SCD Type 2 Scope**: Limited historical tracking to key customer attributes that impact business analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Designed for batch-oriented ETL processing with full data refresh capability
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented indexing strategy based on anticipated query patterns (customer analysis, product performance, time-based reporting)

## Validation Results

### Summary by Category

**Category 1: Referential Integrity**
- ✅ Customer Foreign Key Check: All fact records have valid customer references
- ✅ Product Foreign Key Check: All fact records have valid product references  
- ✅ Date Foreign Key Check: All fact records have valid date references
- **Result**: 100% referential integrity maintained

**Category 2: Range Validation**
- ✅ Quantity Range Check: All quantities within business-reasonable range (1-1000)
- ✅ Unit Price Range Check: All prices within expected range ($0.01-$10,000)  
- ✅ Future Date Check: No orders with future dates detected
- **Result**: All business rules consistently enforced

**Category 3: Date Logic Validation**
- ✅ SCD Date Sequence Check: All effective dates precede expiration dates
- ✅ SCD Current Record Logic: All current records have null expiration dates
- **Result**: SCD Type 2 temporal logic functioning correctly

**Category 4: Calculation Consistency**
- ✅ Amount Calculation Check: All total amounts match (quantity × unit_price) - discount formula
- ✅ SCD Customer Uniqueness Check: Each customer has exactly one current record
- **Result**: Data consistency maintained across all calculations
